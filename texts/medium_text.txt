Joe Biden to be 2017 Convocation Speaker -  Bojack Horseman just referenced Ithaca! -  Kyle the cat is HOME! - Hello everyone! I posted awhile back about my sister's cat "Kyle" who had hitched a ride allll the from Cortland to Ithaca in a car (unbeknownst to the driver) and made his exit in the Fall Creek neighborhood.  After 9 days of countless hours and walking God knows how many miles of searching, WE GOT HIM!!!  Thank you all for your support and concern!   Joe Biden's Convocation Speech -  My grandmother attended Cornell from 1951-1955 and got her BS in Chemistry. I recently found this picture she took in April 1955, with a view of the Clocktower as seen from the Arts Quad. I thought some fellow Cornellians might enjoy it! -  So excited to be admitted! Can't believe I'm going to an Ivy League School! -  Sunrise over the B-lot yesterday morning -  PSA to prefrosh: why cornell is going to be better than ever - welcome incoming freshmen! youre probably pretty pumped and i wanted to add to that by saying that cornell feels like a more accommodating place for new/continuing students than its ever been. 

some things off the top of my head: 

- as mentioned in another post, uber/lyft are now allowed in upstate NY which means that you can get a ride to go to target, wegmans, the airport or wherever you want really. without a car back in the day (lol) people had to rely on TCAT to get around town which ran irregularly and was a pain to carry bags or groceries on. 

- big red bikes means that if youre an engineer living in the townhouses or a food science major living on west your life is about to get a LOT easier. downside is incoming students wont get to know every crack in the sidewalk on east ave or tower road but I think you guys will get over it

- greenstar is in collegetown!! its been open for a little while now but before this people would have to either bus to wegmans (at least 3 hours total) or settle for the stuff at 7 eleven

- anabels grocery is supposed to be opening this summer. if walking to ctown was too far and youd still like to cook then you can get your groceries right on campus. a lot if not all of the produce is local and prices are apparently very reasonable

- safety improvements. i know that prospective students might have read about the rash of assaults in ithaca that have occurred over the past year, which was out of the norm, but i wanted to point out that cornell has been trying to make campus safer. new lighting installed on the slope, i believe more blue lights as well, and the big red shuttle will ferry students around campus from 12 to 3 am on weekends. 

- fancy new vending machines in the dorms means you can buy headphones or tylenol or whatever on the go instead of having to trudge all the way to the cornell store in the snow come winter or off-campusand no longer have to deal with getting everything shipped to you via amazon.  

- general lack of construction. i think most of the new apartments in collegetown will be finished by this fall as will the MBA center, and upson should be renovated by then as well. the ag quad will also be newly refurbished. schwartz performing arts center will have a new seating area and patio out front. regardless of what youre studying youll probably get to spend a significant amount of time in at least one state-of-the-art new building.

someone with a lot less to complain about Far above ... -  On the Arts Quad: You had one job... -  Facebook posted this automatically for some reason, but I think it adequately sums up the last four years of my life. -  An Update on the Missing Student - The following announcement was sent out to the entire student body at approximately 1 PM today. We are saddened by this news, and hope that the users of r/Cornell will keep his family in their thoughts. 

Dear Cornell students,

It is with profound sadness that I write with the news that law enforcement search teams have recovered Aalaap Narasipuras body. No foul play is suspected, and a full investigation of the circumstances is underway.

A senior electrical engineering student in the College of Engineering, Aalaap was an ambitious student and was scheduled to graduate early this December. He was active on the Ultimate Frisbee team, enjoyed taking photos, and planned to continue at Cornell to pursue a Masters of Engineering degree.

As we all struggle to process Aalaaps death, I encourage you to reach out to others for support and to make use of the resources listed at the bottom of this email. For community members wishing to come together during this difficult time there will be a community support meeting on Friday, May 19, at 4 p.m. in the One World Room, Anabel Taylor Hall.

On behalf of the Cornell University community, I extend our deepest condolences to Aalaaps family and friends as they grieve this tragedy. They are in our thoughts as we all come to grips with the enormity of this loss.

Ryan Lombardi
Vice President for Student & Campus Life Cornell Football wins again, and is leading the Ivy League. Good job, Big Red. -  For the 2017ers: I moved onto campus in August, 10 years ago. Here's what I wish I was told, what I wish I did, and what I ultimately learned after 4 years far above Cayuga's waters. - [**I wrote a cleaned up version of this on my blog, Table Theory. Check it out.**](http://tabletheory.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/the-table-theory-guide-for-the-cornell-university-class-of-2017/)

A lot of this will sound obvious. Well, fuck you, because I didn't know this shit as a 17 year old straight-laced tightwad nerd who was getting his first taste of freedom.

(For reference, I'm now a 27 year old tightwad nerd... though much less straight laced and probably a little drunk).

**Academics**

* Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. It's okay. It just means that, *gasp*, you have something to learn.
* Ask for help if you need it. Seriously. Don't be an asshole like I was and think "it's weak to ask for help because I never needed it in HS."
* Go to class. Every single fucking class. And study. Most of the stress people end up having is from not doing well. The stress of studying is easy in comparison.
* Find out what kind of worker you are: I'm only effective with lots of structure and scheduling, and deadlines to keep me on track. I didn't learn that until after I made a really stupid, lazy roster. Take the first semester to learn how to be effective, and apply it the rest of your 4 years.
* Be smart about how much you can reasonably handle per semester. Yes, you're a full time student, but you need time to unwind, too.
* If you are a gamer, your room is the WORST place to study. Go outside, or to a library, or to CTB, or anywhere. Just not in front of your computer and its sweet, sweet Counterstrike.
* Learn to swim over the summer if you don't know already. CU actually has really fun gym class options, and it sucks to have to spend a semester learning how to swim when you can be rock climbing/pistol shooting/archery-ing/riding horses instead.

**Social Stuff**

* At orientation, you'll lots of people. It's exciting. One of them may even touch your boner (or lady boner). So, be friendly - but also be realistic. Finding people you click with takes effort, so yes, you have to put your best foot forward and get out there, but that doesn't mean latching onto the first person who tolerates you. Be upbeat, have something to offer everyone, and really feel people out from the perspective of whether you really enjoy spending your time with them.
* Talk to everyone. You don't have to be best friends with everyone, but introduce yourself. Ask them about what they like. Listen. You're going to meet people from places you've never been who grew up in ways you never did. Learn and, when possible, have fun with them.
* Start a dinner group. Even just two people. It's therapeutic.
* DO NOT HAVE YOUR FIRST DRUNKEN EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG ENOUGH TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE. Teenagers have no fucking clue on how to take care of a drunk. So, yeah, have a drink or two, but don't give into shot pressure if you know you suck at drinking (or have no idea how much you can drink). Also, medical amnesty - if you pass out, call the fucking EMTs. People die when they ignore this.
* When you first throw up and get your first hangover, don't be the dick who says "I'm never drinking again." Just suck it up, drink some gatorade, brush your teeth and walk it of. Your liver will be taking much more punishment in the next four years.
* I found that the best way to meet people I clicked with was through activities - so make sure you check out the club fairs, and try a lot of things out the first couple weeks. After that, stick around for what ACTIVITY you enjoy most. Trust me, you'll build much stronger friendships if you follow your passion, rather than just joining something because the people seem cool to you.
* On that note, join the ballroom dance team *cough cough.*

**Dorms and Roommates**

* Good boundaries are key, and unless you both grew up responsible enough to never need your parents to clean up after you, you have shitty boundaries. No problem, but always remember that in any dispute, *you might be the asshole in that scenario.*
* Be a person of your word. Be prepared to split chores, and even do some things that you dislike, because your roommate will also be doing things he or she dislikes. It beats being passive aggressive and hating the hours you have to spend in your room because you're not allowed to sleep anywhere else.
* That said, even when your roommate situation is great, less time in your room is best for everyone who lives there.
* Sexile is not completely off-limits as long as you call ahead, and make it worth your roommate's while. He or she will be doing you a solid, so either be prepared to reciprocate in some way or don't do it.
* It's not where you live, it's what you make of it. I know more people who are still friends/in touch from Donlon 6 today than from any other dorm I've ever heard of.
* On that note, just because you're living in the same building as someone doesn't make it more likely for you to end up as good friends. Hang around people because you like them not because it's easy.
* If you piss on the seat, clean it, or vigilante justice IS warranted. 

**Dating**

* This is for guys and girls. Don't rush into or out of relationships. College is a different ball field, yes, but that doesn't mean you should just go all in or all out. This is one of the few times in your life when it's really completely cool to just be unattached - where no one will be in your business and making you feel like an asshole or a slut for dating lots of people (okay, some people may still do that. But, none of them is writing you a paycheck, so fuck 'em). At the same time, don't just bail on a good situation just because you can. You'll stunt your growth in relationships in either extreme.
* For the love of god, people, if someone wants to spend time with you, they will make it as easy as possible. If you have to call someone 5 times for them to even answer, they don't wanna hang out with you, holmes. Sorry.
* Nice clothes (non-college bum couture) goes a pretty long way in making you noticeable.
* Never, ever date someone just because the sex is good. Make that person a FWB. And don't be ashamed of that arrangement. It's actually kind of awesome.
* If you're a virgin, it's cool. Lots of people willing to let you practice.
* If you want to stay a virgin, that's cool too. There are lots of people who are doing the same thing.

**Cornelliana that I personally really loved**

* Go to your corny floor events. Go to the corny dances. Go to all of the things, at least to stop by and see it. You'll miss it after you've graduated.
* Go gorge jumping. There's only a short period of time when it's actually warm enough on campus to do. Make sure you a) know how to swim, and b) are with someone who knows how to get to the jump points.
* You gotta go to at least ONE frat party. I'm a party animal, and even then frat parties weren't my thing (too many people I didn't know) - but I never would have known that and then learned to throw my own parties if I didn't try one.
* Risley is pretty fuckin' cool. If they still have it, ask about pool. Or a Balch run. Also, go to at least one Rocky Horror picture show.
* Cornell cinema regularly shows films that you might never see anywhere else. Check it out.
* Buy an article of Cornell clothing. There are so many of us in the world that I'm always surprised by how much Cornell gear I see out there - instant connection. 
* Slope Day. Forever and always.

**Other Thoughts**

* Ithaca ruins shoes. Bring sturdy snow boots. That's all you'll hear me say about the weather.

I looked though the terms and conditions but didn't seem to find anything of that nature; I'm scared that if I show someone a LiveLeak video the Cornell Thug Squad will descend upon my residence. Need a quiet place to study in Collegetown during study week? - Study week will be upon us shortly. St. Luke Church in Collegetown (right next to CTB) has a tradition of opening its doors to provide a quiet study environment for students. No proselytizing, just an act of community service. 

*St. Luke Church will be open from Saturday May 13 through Monday May 22, 10am to Midnight (except Sundays  1pm to Midnight)
*Wireless available throughout the building
*There will be FREE coffee, tea, and snacks
*Welcome to bring your own food
*Several small group study rooms available for  quiet study

(NSFW language) -  Cornell Drinking Culture - Let me begin by saying that this isn't specific to Cornell, but just an opinion based off of what I've seen here over the past couple of weeks.

I'm a freshman at Cornell and I'm really starting to dislike the drinking culture here. I've been to a frat party almost every week I've been here, and I've noticed so many things here. Seeing 4 ambulances outside my residence hall this night is what motivated me to write this. 

Drinking is like machinery here. People all around me go out on the weekends, no matter how much work they have, if they've been invited somewhere or not, etc. The weekend is time to drink and that's unchangable. You pregame at X o clock, catch the bus at Y, go to the party for Z, etc. Every weekend I see almost everyone on my floor do this. I see crowds of dozens of people all going to CTown or west campus or wherever they can get some booze. 

At the parties themselves, people all are just trying to get a beer or whatever alcohol they can lay their hands on. It's honestly just depressing. Everyone complains that the beer is so bad, yet they keep drinking. Do they really need to be drunk that badly? 

I hear endless stories of girls that can't wait to go out and then those same girls getting assaulted at night or making a decision they regret. But they go and do it again the next weekend.

I hear guys stressing about how hard it is for them to find a ratio that works and how annoying and douchey the frat guys are. But they go and do it again the next weekend.

Kids with so much potential are drinking themselves to a point of injury (I've seen so many ambulances show up to different dorms or houses). But they go and go it again the next weekend.

Why? I wish I knew. I'll admit why I go: peer pressure. Everyone is going out and I feel left out if I don't. I went out again this weekend, and hated it. I didn't even drink. But can Ivy League students really not find any other way to have fun during the weekends? Does everyone who drinks think that since they had a hard week they need to alter their reality for a couple of hours to relax?

I wanted to get your guys' opinions on the matter. And I understand that not everyone at Cornell drinks. There are thousands who don't. I'm talking about the culture of those who do.

Hey, something Cornell related made /r/all ag...oh wait.... -  Greetings from your new moderators! - Hi everyone! It's /u/laveritecestla, /u/TheD3xus, and /u/Enyo287, your new /r/Cornell moderating staff! We wanted to take the time to introduce ourselves to you guys, that way everyone can get a better idea of who we are and what we plan on doing to help improve the subreddit. We want to be here for you as a community, and we want to be on the same page with what people are looking to get out of the subreddit.

#/u/laveritecestla
Hi r/Cornell! I'm /u/laveritecestla, and I'm super excited to be one of the new mods here. I'm a current student in biomedical engineering, and am involved in many extracurricular activities on campus. I plan to deal largely with content management (updating the sidebar, creating a comprehensive FAQ section, etc.) and weekly threads (chance me, Q&A for prospective students, etc.). If there are any weekly threads you'd like to see, please let me know (by PM).  I can't promise we'll end up implementing all of your ideas, but we may be able to create threads that encompass several of your ideas at once. Looking forward to improving this subreddit! 

# /u/TheD3xus
Hello /r/Cornell! I'm /u/TheD3xus, one of three new ~~dictators~~ moderators for the subreddit.

Someone then found his website and it says the following in a blogpost: 
"I can do some touring for a few months at least right now. Maybe even 5-6 months. I'm thinking about maybe joining the military in 2014 by summer. I've sort of had that fantasy since 2008 now, after times got tough. I figure in the long term, "order" won't hurt me, where this country is headed. I'm on the road, driving. **I'm headed to CU, B. Hall, in I, NY.** Them are initials for something. Figure it out. I'm serious."

what Cornell Installs Indoor Lawn during Study Week -  Getting used to not liking college - Title pretty much sums it up. Cornell is meh. Lots of work. Isolated place, lots of competition, little time for socializing. Sophomore CS.

You know, this year I said I would socialize more and it's been fun and all, but my grades have suffered, my sleep schedule is garbanzo beans, and I don't even think I'm any happier.

That said, I'm used to it at this point. My high school friends are having a blast at their lib arts schools. We out here tho.

i'm a freshman who suspects clinical depression, and I finally feel the confidence to approach counseling. Should I schedule an appointment with gannett or should I look elsewhere?  Search fails to find Cornell student; memorial planned Monday night -  unbearably lonely - I'm a new sophomore transfer, and I'm really struggling socially- it's been two months and I don't have a single friend. I didn't have friends at my old school (or high school...), and I really hoped that Cornell would be a fresh start and I would finally "find my people". I joined clubs that I'm interested in, I talked to people during orientation, but nothing really panned out and now I feel like everyone has settled into a routine and isn't actively looking for new friends.

I know that I have a lot of underlying social anxiety/self esteem issues that are holding me back, so I'm trying to figure out how to get through that. Therapy was something my parents wanted me to look into when I was having similar problems at my old school, so I called Cornell Health counseling last week, but they told me it would be over a month before I could make an appointment. I don't want to go to EARS or any of that bullshit, but I don't know what my other options are.

I can feel myself slipping back into the same depressive cycle I was in last year, and while I really don't want that to happen I don't know how to prevent it. Seeing everyone with their friends at homecoming and halloween parties makes me want to cry because I feel like I'll never get to have those experiences.

:( New freshman struggling socially - I dont really know where to go with this so Im just bringing it here. Im a new freshman and Im just really struggling socially. Im not (normally) a particularly introverted or anti-social person, but when I arrived here I pretty just froze up. I havent made any friends since getting and in reality only have a few acquaintances. I know its still relatively early, but it does seem like people are solidifying legitimate friend groups, and I just dont know what to do at this point to go about making friends. Id appreciate any sort of advice possible.
 How do I get access to a psychiatrist? - I suffer from severe depression and recently it's been getting the best of me. I would love to have someone to talk to about it but I'm not sure if i'm making the right steps. To schedule an appointment someone has to call me to asses me? What does that entail? Thanks!

It has a one-time cost of 99 cents, but please check out the app-descriptions and see if you think it's worth it. I started this project to use for myself and just wanted to bring it to others, so I will continue updating it and making it even better.

If you're interested in either finding people to play with (casually or competitively) or helping out with the organization feel free to leave a comment or PM me!

Happy spring break, register before you leave!!! Lacrosse team suspended and all games cancelled due to hazing allegations -  Cornell Lacrosse beats Maryland, advances to next round! -  Kicked Out of Cornell for a Semester - As stated in the titled, I am placed on academic leave for a semester due to my poor academics. I failed 3 courses since the beginning of my freshman year including multi-variable calc, bio, and a writing seminar driving down my GPA to 1.7. The root cause was mainly from a lack of motivation, languishing in my dorm for hours on end, and skipping classes for weeks at a time. Perhaps this was a symptom of depression that I had refused to seek out help for or perhaps it was from the increasingly hectic domestic situation in which my parents' fights constantly involved me even though I was hundreds of miles away from home. Whatever the cause, I have come to terms with it and will strive for a more successful remainder of my time at Cornell. So far in this semester I was gone, I had received certifications in EHAC, FEMA, OSHA, Psychological Aid, and inbound marketing while taking 3 courses at my local community college to fulfill distribution requirements. I also picked up a job, volunteered at the Miami AFL-CIO, and Hurricane Relief Shelters. I will mention these in my reflections for reentry in the spring semester. The question remains as to how I will graduate on time. Having missed a semester is a significant roadblock to graduate with my class and I'm not sure as to how to make up for missed time. I'm willing to take 20-22 credits per semester, but even then I'm not sure it'll remedy the situation. I just want to know if you guys have any advice for recovery and recuperation. I'm in the ILR school if this helps. Thank you in advance for the help!

edit: Thanks everyone for the responses! I know we're strangers on the internet, but the level of support and encouragement in this subreddit is quite terrific. I think the willingness of my fellow Cornellians to help some random guy on the internet is indicative of the character of this community. I will take these recommendations to heart and strive to be a better person. I just wanted to let you know you helped one stranger get to a better place mentally. 

With utmost gratitude,

cornellthrowaway Why do I have to eat at my own house during house dinners. - The meal plan says I have Unlimited access to meals during designated service periods within the West Campus House System dining rooms. So freaking stupid to be turned down by the person at the card swiping station because its not my house. Well maybe I dont want to eat the few foods that were prepared at my specific dining hall. Literally cannot stand house dinners. Also the gross used cloth napkins people leave all over the table because nobody knows where to put them. Maybe they should actually tell you the rules of house dinners in the description. Ugh  Where to buy pads and tampons on campus? - Is there anywhere on campus (preferably north-ish) to buy feminine hygiene products?  My swim class starts tomorrow and Im not about to go big red without tampons.   How intensive are the beginner art classes? - I'm an engineer and thinking of taking ART 2201: Intro to Painting as one of my liberal studies distributions. How rigorous and time consuming is this kind of course? I've tried looking online and I've read many bad reviews of the instructor. I've never had any prior experience painting, and I've also read that these kind of courses are incredibly difficult to pass if you do not have the innate talent. Mud Rush on the Ag Quad, Cornell, 1922. -  Cornell removes webpage touting power of 2% in fraternities -  Any ideas why r/cornell has such a small user base? - Given that Cornell Students are pretty close to the majority demographic of reddit users, I'm surprised at how small this subreddit is. Especially if you consider that a good chunk might be Alumni at this point. Any ideas? Just wanna say that this subreddit is nice. - As nerdy as this sounds, having an online "reddit-community" here for Cornell like this is nice.  It would have helped the socially-awkward and those who stayed in their room mostly.  I was gonna say, "I didn't have this in my time," but I did, although there were a maximum 7 posts on here for about a year.

That being said, everyone should make effort to go out and meet people face to face.  Just that I'm definitely grateful that there are more posts on here now. October 22nd - Cornell meetup - Let's do it on the 22nd. 
I don't live on collegetown so I really dont know that many restaurants. What's a good, affordable restaurant that can fit a pretty large party?

Also, if one of you could be so kind to invite us for video games, board games, etc, that would be great. I live in a small apartment so i don't think cramming into my apartment would be a good idea.


Thanks~~ Cornell Redditors meetup? - It's college, there's gotta be a lot of redditors around campus.
Let's have a meetup sometime after fall break! Cornell Extra Life Gaming Convention and Worlds Viewing Party - Esports at Cornell, the Digital Gaming Alliance, and the Smash Bros. Club will be hosting a 24hour gaming convention this Saturday (4th) in the Appel Commons to raise money for [Extra Life.](http://extra-life.org/) The event will start at 7am and ends 24 hours later on Sunday.

PC and console setups, boardgames, food, and prizes will be found throughout the event. At the end of the day, this is a place for gamers to hang out, have a good time, and raise money for charity! I'm super excited for this event and hope to see you all there. We're still looking for volunteers, so if you're interested in helping out, [please let us know.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecYmflX4ez1ymKqj8u3EQohtwwjTVhwIIFuNBzz4LmNz64UQ/viewform)

As there's really a lot going on during the event, I thought it would be good to highlight a few of the cool things happening during this 24 hour period.

* **The League of Legends Worlds Viewing Party** will be taking place in **RCK 122** (Rockefeller Hall) at 3am on Saturday and will lead into the start of the convention. Riot has sent us some awesome swag, and we'll have snacks! If you are attending, please make sure we know by [RSVPing on Facebook!](https://www.facebook.com/events/717776365080784)

* **The Omegathon Tournament.** I think this is something everyone should be excited about. This is a tournament where each round of the bracket will be a different game. It can be tabletop, pc, or console based, so be prepared for anything! It's a fun event that really shows your skill as a gamer. The first place prize is a **Nintendo Switch**, so you really don't want to miss this! Today is the last day to register for this event, so please check out the event page below if you are interested.

* **Hearthstone Fideside Brawl.** Blizzard has hooked us up. If you play Hearthstone at the event at any point during the 24 hour period, you'll unlock an exclusive hero - Nemsy Necrofizzle. We will also be running a Hearthstone tournament in the evening.

* **Smash Bros:** There will both Smash 4 and Melee tournaments at the event! In the evening, there will be a "Super Mega Battle" which is a format that anyone can play. I'm sure there will be tons of casual play going on throughout the day as well.

If you plan to attend the event, please check out the Facebook event page to keep up with the latest information. **Registration is required for certain parts of the event so please read the "Details" section.**

See (some of you) on Saturday! Is there a place on campus where I can learn new instruments? - I doubt this exists but thought I might as well ask!

I'm not musically talented but like to learn new creative skills to destress.. are there any organizations, clubs, or classes that teach instruments to beginners? I'm interested in percussions, guitar, piano, or even learning to handle studio equipments! (Not so much wind instruments at the moment)

Thank you! finding internships is stressful as hell -  Transfer Students Forced to Live in North Campus Lounges -  What are your favorite places on and off campus? - Incoming grad student here. I just got settled into my apartment and am feeling a little overwhelmed by how much *stuff* there is around here. I got my BA in a town where the most exciting thing to do was walk to Walgreens, so this is a lot more life than I'm used to. I've given myself a little walking tour of (parts of) campus and I've been down to the Commons a few times, but I know there's a lot more to be seen. What are your favorite places around here? 

For reference, I live basically on top of Cascadilla gorge and, while I prefer walking in the summertime, have a car.  Cornell these days -  Last Call for College Bars -  Reminder: Reddit Meetup this Saturday (9/1), details inside! - As many of you know, the official /r/Cornell meetup was moved to this upcoming Saturday because of a scheduling conflict with the free concert last weekend. We were also considering changing the venue, but it looks like the weather is going to cooperate and so we're planning to have the meetup in my backyard so we can use the grill/fire pit out back. There will be food and drinks (just please don't show up already drunk), and feel free to bring friends!

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who came!
 3110 Prelim - I'm getting weeded out  i can't be the only one who thinks info sessions are awkward as hell? - specifically the networking part when you have 200+ people trying to speak to like 6 representatives from the company. and everyone is pushing while trying not to seem passive aggressive about it??

i mean i understand why they hold these network sessions but its just so awkward and I just can't see how it's comfortable having all these people crowd around you Overwatch event this Saturday (tomorrow) - Since reddit and gaming have a pretty big overlap, I just thought I'd let everyone know there is an Overwatch event happening tomorrow at 1pm in 318 Phillips.

The event is sponsored by Tespa, so there will be lots of Blizzard swag given away! Great classes at Cornell? - I'm an incoming freshman and I thought it would be really cool if people posted about the most impactful or fun classes they've taken at Cornell Looking back, what do you wish you knew going into Cornell freshman year? - I'm going to be a freshman next fall and was just curious if anyone had some advice they wish they knew going in as a freshman. Any replies are greatly appreciated. Spring Day was an annual celebration at Cornell University, 1900. -  I had a terrible terrible day today - what cheers you up if you had a terrible day  How I feel finishing a final before everyone else -  Are there actually good ways to get help on campus? - The past year or so has really not been going super well for me and I'm at the point where I don't feel like I can deal with my problems anymore. I want to know if someone can help without making things worse. I've had friends deal with Cornell's mental health system in the past and they just got sent home for a semester and that didn't really seem to help them much and I don't think prolonging this another year is actually going to help what's been stressing me, so I'd rather avoid ending up like that if possible, but I also don't want to waste my time just chatting with someone who's just going to give me nonsense advice like trying to be positive. I'm already stressed about all the stuff I have to do, so throwing away more time doesn't seem useful. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. It's 5 in the morning and I got no sleep tonight between my cold and my freaking out about all the class I've missed on top of all my other problems. I can't just keep going on like this and end up being fine with my classes, but I can't think of a way to help this problem that doesn't involve me just repeating the process again a year later. It's not even just the work that's the issue, but it certainly doesn't help to feel like I don't even have the time to think about and deal with these problems properly.  Got an abc violation and have to go to ithaca court. Am i fucked? - I got an abc violation ticket from the ithaca police a while ago and my court date is tommorow. Will this show up on criminal records? Am i royally screwed for my future?


edit: paid a fine and got off scotch free all good baby Any way to get Cornell Dairy products away from school? - HOLY SHIT how does their ice cream/milk taste so good??? I've been a freshman for barely a week and I already know I'm going to miss this stuff. Does Cornell use iClickers? - Silly question, but I'm transferring from another university (that used iClickers) to Cornell this fall and was wondering if they use them, too. Just want to know before I sell it. You can now contribute to improve Cornell's academic calendar -  i feel sort of caught up in the competitive nature at cornell - i dont know if this is just me but i feel like so inferior sometimes... i feel horrible for not doing anything after my freshman year. i feel like people judge me for not "doing enough" even though I'm trying hard to join these "exclusive clubs". I just feel so bad and it really hurts sometimes... is it just me?? What the 'forcible touching' emails sound like to me -  Downfall: Pre-enrollment -  Stanford and Cornell Favored for N.Y. Engineering School - NYTimes.com -  Failed Course, Need Help - Hi,

I'm a freshman (rising sophomore), biological sciences major in CALS on a pre-med track. I just finished my first year up and got solid grades all around (Generally B+ or higher) except first semester Gen. Chem I got a C+, and this past semester I actually failed the class. Seeing as I'm pre-med, I need to take Organic Chem. to stay on the path for graduation at a normal rate, but I failed CHEM 2080, which is a pre-req for Orgo. I just need some advice as to what my best course of action is here, as I know I struggle with Chemistry, but I have a hard time letting go of my pre-med goal because of a few classes in college.

Thanks for any response in advance, feel free to be critical if necessary. Cornell Staff Member Implicated in UNC Academic Scandal -  You all know it's true... -  Hope y'all had a great Slope Day.... anyone see me? :D -  How to sleep in Dickson? - Hello new freshman here just wondering if there are any ways to sound proof my window or any strategies to get sleep in Dickson. My window faces the path which makes it impossible, even with earplugs, to fall asleep at a reasonable time. Huge groups of people walk by yelling until 12. I have to get up at 5 30 every morning and haven't gotten more than 5 hours since I've been here. Any suggestions?. Dairy Bar flavor for Joe Biden: Big Red, White, and Biden -  Gaming in computer labs - I see a people gaming on computer labs pretty frequently. How do people do it, considering that the computer wipes every time you log off. New Subreddit Proposal - Hello r/Cornell! 

A community member reached out to me interested in creating a subreddit focused on Ivy League memes (similar to the Make Cornell Memes Again Facebook group), and reached out to the mod team to see whether this community would be interested in such a venture. Let us know your thoughts here! 

If you are interested and would like to be considered for the mod team, please include that here as well.  Cayuga's Waiters Suspended for Code of Conduct Violations -  Cornell Police Investigating 'Unsubstantiated Threats' to University -  Lost iphone 6 found in Cascadilla Gorge trail -  I have only now discovered these. Hold my fitness pass, /r/Cornell, I'm goin' in. -  Founders of Reddit are coming to Cornell! (2/5/14) -  Is living in Ithaca without a car possible? - If I do well on the LSAT in October I may apply to Cornell law this fall. I do not have a car and will probably not be able to afford one in law school. Is it easy to get around Ithaca without a car? Is there any form of public transportation in the area (I know it is pretty small)?

Any help will be greatly appreciated

Edit: Also is there affordable housing? $800 a month would be ideal Fall break is almost over ... -  It's almost time for BigRed//Hacks! -  Harvard Memes - What do you all think about the ~10 students who have had their acceptance to Harvard rescinded due to some offensive memes they sent?  CGSU Admits Defeat in Unionization Vote -  Anybody want to share their secret bathrooms? - I'll share mine first. It's not exactly secret, but in the loading dock area close to MCLLU, there is a bathroom with the best toilet paper. None of that sandpaper shit everywhere else. Anybody generous enough to share their secret pooping palace? oh god NO -  Anti-Semitic Posters Appear on Cornells Campus -  Rushing/Hazing at Fraternities - Can anyone speak on what people have to do when they are getting hazed? How intense is it, for how long? Examples? Does PsiU get to keep their house? - Since they were removed from campus, and that property is technically owned by Cornell, hypothetically speaking if a frat returned to campus that was previously dormant, would they be able to settle in the old PsiU house? I know that in the DKE suspension, Cornell agreed to allow the DKE to resettle the house once they returned but no where does it seem the case for PsiU. The Nashville Predators have stolen all of Lynah's hockey chants! - Sarcasm, of course. But look at the similarities!

https://section303.com/ Incoming freshman questions - Hi! I've committed to Cornell (so excited!!! please let me leave high school already) and I know it's a bit early, but I just wanted to get an idea of what I'll do there.
For reference, I was admitted to CAS and I'm planning to major in Physics. I think I'll minor in CS, but I'm not too sure about that.

1. I have a 5 in AP Calc BC and I'm confident in my calc ability,
but I don't know if I should take MATH 2230 because I don't have a complete background in multi (studying now)  or linear algebra. Would it be more reasonable for me to take 2210?

2. I'm majoring in physics because I want to do astronomy.
Would it be better for me to hold off on introductory astronomy courses until later or should I take them ASAP?

3. Any must-take classes to fulfill requirements or just because they're fun.
I don't want to overload on classes, though, so I have room to explore.

4. How's Balch Hall? My parents are a bit overprotective so they made me sign up for the women's dorm and put a single as my first choice lol.

5. Since I might get a single, what should I bring?
I've been thinking of getting a printer, but I don't want to waste my money.

6. Where should I buy clothing? I'm from SoCal so I'm totally inexperienced with the snow and I'm not buying winter clothes here lol.
I know good boots are a must.

7. Where to eat? I'm probably getting the meal plan with 10 swipes and $500 BRBs because I heard that most people eat lunch outside of the dining halls and I don't really eat breakfast.

Any other recommendations are welcome. Thank you in advance! Best date locations on campus? - Any opinions on nice date opportunities? 

Casual vs. fancy? Scenic vs. social?

Wanted to hear other opinions. Thanks! Sooo im a dumbass and got pulled over today for reckless driving, a criminal misdemeanor. Could I get kicked out or lose financial aid eligibility because of this? - So I just got home today from finals, finally stress free, and went out with friends in my car to be dumb and have some fun. We found an empty parking lot and I started doing some donuts. By started i mean literally half a donut, then get lit up by an undercover cop car that was parked on the other side of the lot. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, ya I know you don't need to tell me. 

I still need to go to court and hopefully it could get reduced to something less than reckless driving, which is a criminal misdemeanor and I would have a criminal record. If it doesn't get reduced though, could cornell find out about this and could they expel me or some other consequences? I can't really find any info online. 

Really would not be good to fuck up my future over something this stupid. Gay Scene - How's the gay dating/hookup scene at Cornell? Is it hard to finding a gay guy to date? What are the unknown advantages of being a Cornell student? - Things like free Microsoft Office, discounts to restaurants, etc... That nobody tells you about?
