Cornell football beat Harvard! -  In the Ivy League, /r/Cornell is #1 in reddit subscriber count. - It's something I guess. Sounds a hell of a lot better than #1 in Title IX cases. 
 
 
 
I'm going to give one fact about each of the other Ivy subreddits that highlights the fact that /r/Cornell is far superior.

**Brown** (1404 subscribers) - Currently has 2 moderators. One created the sub 6 years ago, the other is class of 2021 and doesn't attend Brown yet. Edit: Also uses Naut for their subreddit design. Lazy ass mods. 

**Columbia** (2424 subscribers) - Has no CSS design, completely vanilla. Lazier ass mods. 

**Dartmouth** (711 subscribers) - I mean... its Dartmouth. 

**Harvard** (2766 subscribers) - The only subreddit to not have links to the rest of the Ivy League in the sidebar. Pompous assholes. 

**Princeton** (1577 subscribers) - Most upvoted post of *all time* has 44 upvotes. 

**University of Pennsylvania** (2006 subscribers) - 2 flairs exist. Both are empty flairs. What?

**Yale** (1586 subscribers) - Only has 2 mods, neither of which currently attend Yale, and their most recent post is someone asking about something called tuition insurance.




I'm really *really* bored at my internship, okay? The golden book from the gif at the top of r/interestingasfuck is from the Cornell Library -  Hi /r/Cornell, I did a thing in 4K! Hope you like it :) -  Found on Ithaca Craigslist :D (Seeking Overpriced Housing Near Downtown Ithaca) -  Went on pornhub on Cornell WiFi, how screwed am I? -  Two IC Students Stabbed at Cornell on Sunday Morning; One dead, One in Critical Condition -  Can we please have a rule against admission threads? - The questions and answers for these threads are always the exact same. OP: "Here's my GPA, activities resume, etc. What are my chances of getting in?" Commenters: "We're not admissions officers; there's no way of telling. Just apply and good luck." It's redundant to say the least any time a thread like this is posted. The purpose of the subreddit is for people to talk about the ongoings of Cornell, events at the college, class questions, and the like. If you hop on over to /r/Harvard right now you can see that admissions posts aren't allowed there because they were plagued by these crappy threads to the point it was unbearable, and we shouldn't have to wait until we get to that point. Literally all of these questions could be better answered by a simple google search or post on College Confidential.

TL;DR: Admissions questions are pointless and fill up the front page with redundant questions and answers; let's get rid of them. Today I went to Wegman's for the first time.

Sincerley,
Definitely not Cornell PD Anyone know what the Pokemon Go situation is like on campus? - Question is in the title.  Any Pokestops around?  Gyms? How it feels staying in Ithaca for the summer. -  I'm totally lost. - I'm going to be a senior in Computer Science and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do after I graduate. Now this may be a common problem, but I think if I have deeper issues because I get incredibly depressed at the thought of working in an office environment at a cubicle. It feels incredibly stifling and monotonous to me. 

I had an internship at a Fortune 500 company last summer that I really disliked, and I quit my internship at that same company 2 weeks into this summer because I just couldn't pull through mentally. To be honest, I only majored in CS because my parents told me to. I haven't enjoyed it at all. And frankly I attended Cornell because my parents told me to as well; otherwise, I most likely would have just gone to my highly regarded state school (they did pay for my education in full though, which I'm incredibly grateful for).

I've always liked the thought of owning my own business. There's this new building in a shopping plaza that opened up near my house.  Every time I walk by I always think to myself how great it would be if I were to run a business in a space like that. But I don't have any idea as to WHAT that business would entail.  

And of course, even if I did have an idea as to what that business would be, it's incredibly risky to pursue something like that and forgo traditional employment. Am I just lazy? Depressed? Naive? I just can't seem to come up with what I'd like to end up doing if I weren't running my own thing. I will be going to career services when I get on campus, but from what I've heard, they aren't particularly helpful. 

Meanwhile, my classmates seem to be enjoying their highly paid internships in New York City, Bay Area, etc, and all I've done is sit at home trying to make sense of things. Does anybody have advice for someone who just feels incredibly lost and hopeless?  Cornell Club NYC - Is anyone a member?  Is it worth the cost?

(from a lonely freshman) - Hi,

I realize it's still very early into college, and clubs are the best way to meet people, but I'm feeling a bit hopeless. I came from a big NYC high school that has a large representation here but I only talk to ~4 of them, and we're not that close. Also they all know each other well so I feel excluded from that group.

I do talk to some people who live near me but they're in Hotel/Architecture while I'm in Engineering (CS major btw) so we can't see each other that often. I talked to a lot of people during orientation, but I didn't find a lot that had common interests with me (I guess that's what clubs are for?) I haven't been able to talk to people in my classes, and everyone already seems to have friends that they eat/walk with. 

I feel overwhelmed and miserable, and I feel a lot more pressure to find friends/hang out with people than I did back home (where I did have a good group of friends that has now scattered). 

I guess what I'm asking is, do you have any advice with dealing with this? Is there anything I can do until or even after the club fair? Any stories relating to this? I'm not too into parties btw.

TLDR: Having trouble making friends, especially in my college/major. Need advice.

PM me for details! Need good advice. In awful situation. - I am in the worst situation right now. I made the mistake of not applying for housing next year because I figured I would be living in a fraternity house, I joined a Fraternity...then left it. After that I applied to be on the wait list and then was told it's unlikely I would get any sort of housing. After a couple of emails they said that I am on their 'priority' list for some sort of housing (I even said a temporary quad would be ok, yes i'm that desperate). Every dime of my tuition is paid for in loans because my family cannot afford for me to attend (the loans are in my name). So as you might imagine I can't afford to live off campus, something I obviously should have considered when I decided to not apply for housing . School is 2 weeks away and I have nowhere to live. I don't know what I am looking for, but any help someone might be able to give would be appreciated. Thanks.

Tier 1 | $16500 | $15000 | -9.1%

The cuts hit the lower tier clubs especially hard--if you are in a small tier 6 club, your funding cap has been lowered by 1/3rd this year.

I graduated from Cornell May 2015 and am quite proud to say Cornell was one of the best highlights of my life. It seems surreal that exactly 6 years and 2 days ago, I first walked onto the campus during move in day; hearing that school starts again really made me feel nostalgic. 

Quick background on me - I came in as a sophomore year transfer but stayed an extra year due to changing majors, and ended up getting full 4 years of experience as a Big Red. I majored in ORIE in the engineering school and currently am working my dream job, having a blast.

Hopefully this doesn't come off as one of those self-proclaimed "AMA's", but would love to try and offer my insights and answer any questions incoming (or even current) students may have.

Soph transfer here, I'm struggling a lot with adapting to cornell (not in the academic sense).

Backstory: I've struggled with depression for many years now and the biggest thing affecting me is a total lack of motivation. I had an awful experience at my previous uni and I thought coming to Cornell would help, but it hasn't. It has prevented me from functioning correctly (i.e. im too depressed/have no motivation to apply for jobs, spend time with friends, join clubs, etc.) 

When I went to Clubfest i had this same problem. I had no motivation to join any of the clubs and I would be forcing myself to join if i did. However, 2 clubs actually caught my eye and interested me a lot (something that rarely happens nowadays). I poured my heart and soul into preparing for their tryouts (again, something I rarely do) and both of them rejected me, and its been hitting me REALLY hard. I've lost the sliver of motivation I had when trying out for these clubs and everything feels mechanical. It feels devastating knowing my best isn't good enough for either of them (and one of these clubs I did in HS for 2 years, so I thought I would do well enough...)

I do go to counseling sessions at CHealth, but other people don't really understand. They tell me things like "just join other clubs", but i physically cannot force myself to join a club I have no motivation to pursue. Any advice for what to do next? I am still not a member of any clubs, and I feel massive guilt for not doing anything on campus.

Though playing a drum seems especially cool, even if my apartment mates will surely disagree after a while. A friend who just graduated Cornell & was active in the band community asked me winds vs brass as a starting question when I said I wanted to join, and I was so caught up in the options that I froze up and said "drums."
