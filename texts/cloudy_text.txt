Cornell's President, Elizabeth Garrett, has passed away -  Cornell football beat Harvard! -  It's the most wonderful time of the year -  Cornell Basic Boys Starter Pack -  In the Ivy League, /r/Cornell is #1 in reddit subscriber count. - It's something I guess. Sounds a hell of a lot better than #1 in Title IX cases. 
 
 
 
I'm going to give one fact about each of the other Ivy subreddits that highlights the fact that /r/Cornell is far superior.

**Brown** (1404 subscribers) - Currently has 2 moderators. One created the sub 6 years ago, the other is class of 2021 and doesn't attend Brown yet. Edit: Also uses Naut for their subreddit design. Lazy ass mods. 

**Columbia** (2424 subscribers) - Has no CSS design, completely vanilla. Lazier ass mods. 

**Dartmouth** (711 subscribers) - I mean... its Dartmouth. 

**Harvard** (2766 subscribers) - The only subreddit to not have links to the rest of the Ivy League in the sidebar. Pompous assholes. 

**Princeton** (1577 subscribers) - Most upvoted post of *all time* has 44 upvotes. 

**University of Pennsylvania** (2006 subscribers) - 2 flairs exist. Both are empty flairs. What?

**Yale** (1586 subscribers) - Only has 2 mods, neither of which currently attend Yale, and their most recent post is someone asking about something called tuition insurance.




I'm really *really* bored at my internship, okay? My grandmother attended Cornell from 1951-1955 and got her BS in Chemistry. I recently found this picture she took in April 1955, with a view of the Clocktower as seen from the Arts Quad. I thought some fellow Cornellians might enjoy it! -  Hi /r/Cornell, I did a thing in 4K! Hope you like it :) -  An Update on the Missing Student - The following announcement was sent out to the entire student body at approximately 1 PM today. We are saddened by this news, and hope that the users of r/Cornell will keep his family in their thoughts. 

Dear Cornell students,

It is with profound sadness that I write with the news that law enforcement search teams have recovered Aalaap Narasipuras body. No foul play is suspected, and a full investigation of the circumstances is underway.

A senior electrical engineering student in the College of Engineering, Aalaap was an ambitious student and was scheduled to graduate early this December. He was active on the Ultimate Frisbee team, enjoyed taking photos, and planned to continue at Cornell to pursue a Masters of Engineering degree.

As we all struggle to process Aalaaps death, I encourage you to reach out to others for support and to make use of the resources listed at the bottom of this email. For community members wishing to come together during this difficult time there will be a community support meeting on Friday, May 19, at 4 p.m. in the One World Room, Anabel Taylor Hall.

On behalf of the Cornell University community, I extend our deepest condolences to Aalaaps family and friends as they grieve this tragedy. They are in our thoughts as we all come to grips with the enormity of this loss.

Happy spring break, register before you leave!!! Need good advice. In awful situation. - I am in the worst situation right now. I made the mistake of not applying for housing next year because I figured I would be living in a fraternity house, I joined a Fraternity...then left it. After that I applied to be on the wait list and then was told it's unlikely I would get any sort of housing. After a couple of emails they said that I am on their 'priority' list for some sort of housing (I even said a temporary quad would be ok, yes i'm that desperate). Every dime of my tuition is paid for in loans because my family cannot afford for me to attend (the loans are in my name). So as you might imagine I can't afford to live off campus, something I obviously should have considered when I decided to not apply for housing . School is 2 weeks away and I have nowhere to live. I don't know what I am looking for, but any help someone might be able to give would be appreciated. Thanks.

I was gonna say, "I didn't have this in my time," but I did, although there were a maximum 7 posts on here for about a year.

That being said, everyone should make effort to go out and meet people face to face.  Just that I'm definitely grateful that there are more posts on here now. Fuck finals week. - That is all.

j/k <3 Ya'll My cat is missing! -  Failed Course, Need Help - Hi,

I'm a freshman (rising sophomore), biological sciences major in CALS on a pre-med track. I just finished my first year up and got solid grades all around (Generally B+ or higher) except first semester Gen. Chem I got a C+, and this past semester I actually failed the class. Seeing as I'm pre-med, I need to take Organic Chem. to stay on the path for graduation at a normal rate, but I failed CHEM 2080, which is a pre-req for Orgo. I just need some advice as to what my best course of action is here, as I know I struggle with Chemistry, but I have a hard time letting go of my pre-med goal because of a few classes in college.

Thanks for any response in advance, feel free to be critical if necessary. i know this question has been asked 1,000,000x before so sorry (for the gays) -   I heard there were 'gay parties' (don't know why that's in quotes) on campus but I'm not in that secret facebook group (don't have one) so I was wondering of there was any other way for me to uh...get involved in that. I'm a freshman and I have met 0 gay people so far so can't go in that direction either...

(2/5/14) -  Is living in Ithaca without a car possible? - If I do well on the LSAT in October I may apply to Cornell law this fall. I do not have a car and will probably not be able to afford one in law school. Is it easy to get around Ithaca without a car? Is there any form of public transportation in the area (I know it is pretty small)?

Any help will be greatly appreciated

Sticked Club Fest like post - With then start of the semester right around the corner it might be a good idea to have a sticked club feast like post on here. It could provide a great resource for people to check out clubs they might want to join in addition to this they run into at the actual club feast at Barton. I personally would be happy to advertise at least 2 clubs. What do you guys think? seeking verification that Irvin Bush taught at Cornell - Hey Cornell,

I'm a College of Charleston student. I've befriended a homeless man here who is strikingly intelligible and well spoken, has friends in all sorts of upper, surprising social circles. He tells me he taught Computer Science at Cornell University before his wife and children were killed by a drunk driver. I'm curious in him and want to believe what he says, am looking for verification. He's 70 years old now, and I'm having a hard time finding records of his existence on the Internet.

If any of you have the ability, can you confirm whether or not an Irvin Bush (spelling may vary) was a professor at your university? It would mean a lot.

Thanks

**update:** cornell's human resources didn't play ball, required a signed release of information. but someone else in the faculty still ended up getting back to me. Irvin's story is false. http://cl.ly/image/2v2E3a3n1j04 We're #2 - Where America's Top CEOs Went to School -  Cornell - GQ states as Douchiest School in America -  Does PsiU get to keep their house? - Since they were removed from campus, and that property is technically owned by Cornell, hypothetically speaking if a frat returned to campus that was previously dormant, would they be able to settle in the old PsiU house? I know that in the DKE suspension, Cornell agreed to allow the DKE to resettle the house once they returned but no where does it seem the case for PsiU. Since July 2000, Cornell's Lake Source Cooling has saved an average of 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year versus previous cooling methods -  Incoming freshman questions - Hi! I've committed to Cornell (so excited!!! please let me leave high school already) and I know it's a bit early, but I just wanted to get an idea of what I'll do there.
For reference, I was admitted to CAS and I'm planning to major in Physics. I think I'll minor in CS, but I'm not too sure about that.

1. I have a 5 in AP Calc BC and I'm confident in my calc ability,
but I don't know if I should take MATH 2230 because I don't have a complete background in multi (studying now)  or linear algebra. Would it be more reasonable for me to take 2210?

2. I'm majoring in physics because I want to do astronomy.
Would it be better for me to hold off on introductory astronomy courses until later or should I take them ASAP?

3. Any must-take classes to fulfill requirements or just because they're fun.
I don't want to overload on classes, though, so I have room to explore.

4. How's Balch Hall? My parents are a bit overprotective so they made me sign up for the women's dorm and put a single as my first choice lol.

5. Since I might get a single, what should I bring?
I've been thinking of getting a printer, but I don't want to waste my money.

6. Where should I buy clothing? I'm from SoCal so I'm totally inexperienced with the snow and I'm not buying winter clothes here lol.
I know good boots are a must.

7. Where to eat? I'm probably getting the meal plan with 10 swipes and $500 BRBs because I heard that most people eat lunch outside of the dining halls and I don't really eat breakfast.

Any other recommendations are welcome. Thank you in advance! Can I join the pep band without already having an instrument to play? And as a grad student? - Also please sound off on what instrument you'd recommend. I'm so new to this whole thing that I'm considering every instrument right now. Everything seems cool. Though playing a drum seems especially cool, even if my apartment mates will surely disagree after a while. A friend who just graduated Cornell & was active in the band community asked me winds vs brass as a starting question when I said I wanted to join, and I was so caught up in the options that I froze up and said "drums."
Also, I'm an incoming masters student who will be around for 2 years and who has obligations as a TA. Hope I still qualify as non-ugrad. Sooo im a dumbass and got pulled over today for reckless driving, a criminal misdemeanor. Could I get kicked out or lose financial aid eligibility because of this? - So I just got home today from finals, finally stress free, and went out with friends in my car to be dumb and have some fun. We found an empty parking lot and I started doing some donuts. By started i mean literally half a donut, then get lit up by an undercover cop car that was parked on the other side of the lot. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, ya I know you don't need to tell me. 

I still need to go to court and hopefully it could get reduced to something less than reckless driving, which is a criminal misdemeanor and I would have a criminal record. If it doesn't get reduced though, could cornell find out about this and could they expel me or some other consequences? I can't really find any info online. 

Really would not be good to fuck up my future over something this stupid. Well screw you too, Cornell Law -  Where can I find dorks like me? - And I use the word dork very affectionately.

My favorite things to do to relax on the weekends are watching movies and shows, playing games (pc, ds, ps, xbox, wii, all of the above), chowing down on junk, and cracking up from the stupidest jokes imaginable.

I haven't found a group like that here. All my friends just want to go out and drink and party and, while that's fun every once in a while, I'd rather sit on a couch and play CIV or something. Which of course means that I don't meet very many people.

Any clubs I should go look at? Anyone recommend anything? Trivia Night every Wednesday, 8:30 at Pixel Lounge! - Hello folks!  I'm the trivia master of Pixel's Wednesday night trivia, and wanted to inform/remind you all that this event is still going on.  Come by Pixel tonight at 8:30 for $10 Long Island Iced Tea or Cherry Blossom pitchers and $2 PBRs all night, and play for a free bar tab certificate!
