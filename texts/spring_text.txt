Cornell's President, Elizabeth Garrett, has passed away -  Cornell after today's rain. -  Joe Biden to be 2017 Convocation Speaker -  Joe Biden's Convocation Speech -  My grandmother attended Cornell from 1951-1955 and got her BS in Chemistry. I recently found this picture she took in April 1955, with a view of the Clocktower as seen from the Arts Quad. I thought some fellow Cornellians might enjoy it! -  So excited to be admitted! Can't believe I'm going to an Ivy League School! -  Found on Ithaca Craigslist :D (Seeking Overpriced Housing Near Downtown Ithaca) -  My great grandfather (Electrical Engineering, '07), and his buddies goofing off before graduation a few years ago. -  PSA to prefrosh: why cornell is going to be better than ever - welcome incoming freshmen! youre probably pretty pumped and i wanted to add to that by saying that cornell feels like a more accommodating place for new/continuing students than its ever been. 

some things off the top of my head: 

- as mentioned in another post, uber/lyft are now allowed in upstate NY which means that you can get a ride to go to target, wegmans, the airport or wherever you want really. without a car back in the day (lol) people had to rely on TCAT to get around town which ran irregularly and was a pain to carry bags or groceries on. 

- big red bikes means that if youre an engineer living in the townhouses or a food science major living on west your life is about to get a LOT easier. downside is incoming students wont get to know every crack in the sidewalk on east ave or tower road but I think you guys will get over it

- greenstar is in collegetown!! its been open for a little while now but before this people would have to either bus to wegmans (at least 3 hours total) or settle for the stuff at 7 eleven

- anabels grocery is supposed to be opening this summer. if walking to ctown was too far and youd still like to cook then you can get your groceries right on campus. a lot if not all of the produce is local and prices are apparently very reasonable

- safety improvements. i know that prospective students might have read about the rash of assaults in ithaca that have occurred over the past year, which was out of the norm, but i wanted to point out that cornell has been trying to make campus safer. new lighting installed on the slope, i believe more blue lights as well, and the big red shuttle will ferry students around campus from 12 to 3 am on weekends. 

- fancy new vending machines in the dorms means you can buy headphones or tylenol or whatever on the go instead of having to trudge all the way to the cornell store in the snow come winter or off-campusand no longer have to deal with getting everything shipped to you via amazon.  

- general lack of construction. i think most of the new apartments in collegetown will be finished by this fall as will the MBA center, and upson should be renovated by then as well. the ag quad will also be newly refurbished. schwartz performing arts center will have a new seating area and patio out front. regardless of what youre studying youll probably get to spend a significant amount of time in at least one state-of-the-art new building.

someone with a lot less to complain about Cornell Calendar {Circa 1909} -  Cornell & Ithaca (1920's Era Photobook) -  Facebook posted this automatically for some reason, but I think it adequately sums up the last four years of my life. -  An Update on the Missing Student - The following announcement was sent out to the entire student body at approximately 1 PM today. We are saddened by this news, and hope that the users of r/Cornell will keep his family in their thoughts. 

Dear Cornell students,

It is with profound sadness that I write with the news that law enforcement search teams have recovered Aalaap Narasipuras body. No foul play is suspected, and a full investigation of the circumstances is underway.

A senior electrical engineering student in the College of Engineering, Aalaap was an ambitious student and was scheduled to graduate early this December. He was active on the Ultimate Frisbee team, enjoyed taking photos, and planned to continue at Cornell to pursue a Masters of Engineering degree.

As we all struggle to process Aalaaps death, I encourage you to reach out to others for support and to make use of the resources listed at the bottom of this email. For community members wishing to come together during this difficult time there will be a community support meeting on Friday, May 19, at 4 p.m. in the One World Room, Anabel Taylor Hall.

On behalf of the Cornell University community, I extend our deepest condolences to Aalaaps family and friends as they grieve this tragedy. They are in our thoughts as we all come to grips with the enormity of this loss.

Ryan Lombardi
Vice President for Student & Campus Life For the 2017ers: I moved onto campus in August, 10 years ago. Here's what I wish I was told, what I wish I did, and what I ultimately learned after 4 years far above Cayuga's waters. - [**I wrote a cleaned up version of this on my blog, Table Theory. Check it out.**](http://tabletheory.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/the-table-theory-guide-for-the-cornell-university-class-of-2017/)

A lot of this will sound obvious. Well, fuck you, because I didn't know this shit as a 17 year old straight-laced tightwad nerd who was getting his first taste of freedom.

(For reference, I'm now a 27 year old tightwad nerd... though much less straight laced and probably a little drunk).

**Academics**

* Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. It's okay. It just means that, *gasp*, you have something to learn.
* Ask for help if you need it. Seriously. Don't be an asshole like I was and think "it's weak to ask for help because I never needed it in HS."
* Go to class. Every single fucking class. And study. Most of the stress people end up having is from not doing well. The stress of studying is easy in comparison.
* Find out what kind of worker you are: I'm only effective with lots of structure and scheduling, and deadlines to keep me on track. I didn't learn that until after I made a really stupid, lazy roster. Take the first semester to learn how to be effective, and apply it the rest of your 4 years.
* Be smart about how much you can reasonably handle per semester. Yes, you're a full time student, but you need time to unwind, too.
* If you are a gamer, your room is the WORST place to study. Go outside, or to a library, or to CTB, or anywhere. Just not in front of your computer and its sweet, sweet Counterstrike.
* Learn to swim over the summer if you don't know already. CU actually has really fun gym class options, and it sucks to have to spend a semester learning how to swim when you can be rock climbing/pistol shooting/archery-ing/riding horses instead.

**Social Stuff**

* At orientation, you'll lots of people. It's exciting. One of them may even touch your boner (or lady boner). So, be friendly - but also be realistic. Finding people you click with takes effort, so yes, you have to put your best foot forward and get out there, but that doesn't mean latching onto the first person who tolerates you. Be upbeat, have something to offer everyone, and really feel people out from the perspective of whether you really enjoy spending your time with them.
* Talk to everyone. You don't have to be best friends with everyone, but introduce yourself. Ask them about what they like. Listen. You're going to meet people from places you've never been who grew up in ways you never did. Learn and, when possible, have fun with them.
* Start a dinner group. Even just two people. It's therapeutic.
* DO NOT HAVE YOUR FIRST DRUNKEN EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG ENOUGH TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE. Teenagers have no fucking clue on how to take care of a drunk. So, yeah, have a drink or two, but don't give into shot pressure if you know you suck at drinking (or have no idea how much you can drink). Also, medical amnesty - if you pass out, call the fucking EMTs. People die when they ignore this.
* When you first throw up and get your first hangover, don't be the dick who says "I'm never drinking again." Just suck it up, drink some gatorade, brush your teeth and walk it of. Your liver will be taking much more punishment in the next four years.
* I found that the best way to meet people I clicked with was through activities - so make sure you check out the club fairs, and try a lot of things out the first couple weeks. After that, stick around for what ACTIVITY you enjoy most. Trust me, you'll build much stronger friendships if you follow your passion, rather than just joining something because the people seem cool to you.
* On that note, join the ballroom dance team *cough cough.*

**Dorms and Roommates**

* Good boundaries are key, and unless you both grew up responsible enough to never need your parents to clean up after you, you have shitty boundaries. No problem, but always remember that in any dispute, *you might be the asshole in that scenario.*
* Be a person of your word. Be prepared to split chores, and even do some things that you dislike, because your roommate will also be doing things he or she dislikes. It beats being passive aggressive and hating the hours you have to spend in your room because you're not allowed to sleep anywhere else.
* That said, even when your roommate situation is great, less time in your room is best for everyone who lives there.
* Sexile is not completely off-limits as long as you call ahead, and make it worth your roommate's while. He or she will be doing you a solid, so either be prepared to reciprocate in some way or don't do it.
* It's not where you live, it's what you make of it. I know more people who are still friends/in touch from Donlon 6 today than from any other dorm I've ever heard of.
* On that note, just because you're living in the same building as someone doesn't make it more likely for you to end up as good friends. Hang around people because you like them not because it's easy.
* If you piss on the seat, clean it, or vigilante justice IS warranted. 

**Dating**

* This is for guys and girls. Don't rush into or out of relationships. College is a different ball field, yes, but that doesn't mean you should just go all in or all out. This is one of the few times in your life when it's really completely cool to just be unattached - where no one will be in your business and making you feel like an asshole or a slut for dating lots of people (okay, some people may still do that. But, none of them is writing you a paycheck, so fuck 'em). At the same time, don't just bail on a good situation just because you can. You'll stunt your growth in relationships in either extreme.
* For the love of god, people, if someone wants to spend time with you, they will make it as easy as possible. If you have to call someone 5 times for them to even answer, they don't wanna hang out with you, holmes. Sorry.
* Nice clothes (non-college bum couture) goes a pretty long way in making you noticeable.
* Never, ever date someone just because the sex is good. Make that person a FWB. And don't be ashamed of that arrangement. It's actually kind of awesome.
* If you're a virgin, it's cool. Lots of people willing to let you practice.
* If you want to stay a virgin, that's cool too. There are lots of people who are doing the same thing.

**Cornelliana that I personally really loved**

* Go to your corny floor events. Go to the corny dances. Go to all of the things, at least to stop by and see it. You'll miss it after you've graduated.
* Go gorge jumping. There's only a short period of time when it's actually warm enough on campus to do. Make sure you a) know how to swim, and b) are with someone who knows how to get to the jump points.
* You gotta go to at least ONE frat party. I'm a party animal, and even then frat parties weren't my thing (too many people I didn't know) - but I never would have known that and then learned to throw my own parties if I didn't try one.
* Risley is pretty fuckin' cool. If they still have it, ask about pool. Or a Balch run. Also, go to at least one Rocky Horror picture show.
* Cornell cinema regularly shows films that you might never see anywhere else. Check it out.
* Buy an article of Cornell clothing. There are so many of us in the world that I'm always surprised by how much Cornell gear I see out there - instant connection. 
* Slope Day. Forever and always.

**Other Thoughts**

* Ithaca ruins shoes. Bring sturdy snow boots. That's all you'll hear me say about the weather.

St. Luke Church in Collegetown (right next to CTB) has a tradition of opening its doors to provide a quiet study environment for students. No proselytizing, just an act of community service. 

*St. Luke Church will be open from Saturday May 13 through Monday May 22, 10am to Midnight (except Sundays  1pm to Midnight)
*Wireless available throughout the building
*There will be FREE coffee, tea, and snacks
*Welcome to bring your own food
*Several small group study rooms available for  quiet study

 President Skorton to leave Cornell in June 2015 to head Smithsonian Institution -  Car, you are drunk! You don't belong on the roof of Risley. -  Me stepping outside today. -  WELCOME TO THE CLASS OF 2021! - As of 5 PM EDT today, decision notifications have been released for all regular decision applicants. 

Congrats to everyone who was admitted!  Chris Cornell has died - I'm so sorry for everyone here. It's truly amazing to see that there is a community of his fans on reddit! I never thought to look for this subreddit until today. Today is a sad day for all of us. 

- a fellow fan Cornell Weather 101: Cornell cold weather for those with little to no experience - Ok everyone. You might have heard bad things about the weather, have experienced northern cold once or twice, or you might just question "how bad could it be?" Here's the answer you're looking for. I'll try to give you the actual numbers, the intuition of how cold works and how to fight it, and recommendation and rules for buying clothes.

**1) [Click Here For the Weather Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)

**2) Here is my commentary on the weather data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.

**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign to some, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on a talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.

Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.

But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands. Another big things that make a difference is movement/exercise. Walking in the sun vs sitting in the shade can be the difference of 15 to 20 degrees.

Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is becauseand I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a "the human body is awesome" kind of waythat little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.

**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. If you are prepared, you feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas, just with more clothes on. As the Swedes say: "there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing." This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.

First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just a sweater (for the legs it is long underwear). Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.

Other things to think about:

* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.

* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.

* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.

* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.

* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see "goose down 600". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.

**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.

* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, customer support, and everything from them is machine washable. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).

* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.

* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.

* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.

* If you don't wear glasses, buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1428097222&sr=8-3&keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20. If you do, spend the greatest $10 of your life and upgrade to [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Howler-Windproof-Balaclava/dp/B002ZG7RGC/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1428097222&sr=8-6&keywords=balaclava), which seems to have better ventilation based on the reviews.

Cosmos and AMA with Ben Eisenkop, unidan, on Sunday, Plant Sci 233, 8:45 pm - [Announcement Poster](http://i.imgur.com/MB9Bfjm.jpg)

I figure this is the most appropriate place to announce this program, considering our first guest expert.  I'm working with Science Cabaret to bring a program celebrating the 21st century remake and updating of Cosmos.  Cosmos has deep ties to Cornell and the Ithaca community, and it didn't feel right that we were not celebrating it's rebirth here.  Every week we will have a guest expert to comment, provide insight, tell anecdotes, etc., about the episode as we watch it on the big screen in Plant Science 233 (except 3/23 in the Big Red Barn).  There will be a brief interview at 8:45 pm, followed by the show at 9, then concluded with a Q&A (in this case, AMA).

Ben Eisenkop, better known here as /u/unidan, is an enthusiastic proponent of science.  This enthusiasm combined with a seemingly endless knowledge of awesome biological facts has led to him being one of the most famous and beloved users on Reddit.  Cosmos is a public outreach and science enthusiasm program, and this weeks episode features Darwin and Wallace's theory of natural selection.

About 2 days ago I posted a thread linking to a survey regarding the relationship the users of this sub have with the University itself. The response was pretty positive and it seemed like people wanted the results so- here they are!

Now, I know that this survey only only represents a small portion of the sub (142 out of 2,245), but I feel it at least gives a general insight as to who makes up the place. Also, I did keep it up for over two days, so most active users and frequenters probably did have the chance to partake, meaning that the people who post the most and visit the most are represented best. I personally believe this to be a good thing. 

Now for the results:

Female|30|21%

For every *1* female there are *3.7* males

For every *1* male there are *.27* females

Wow. I did not expect it to be this uneven. Men generally use Reddit more, but this contrast is pretty extreme. I'm curious as to why this occurred. Can't argue with the data though.

Relationship| Responses | Percent
:---|:---|:----
Undergraduate Student| 67 | 47%

Undergraduate Students make up almost half of the results

No one responded as "Professor" 

No one responded as "Parent of a Student"

"Others" included:

* Professional Student

*  Ithacan

* PostDoc

...and more

*-*

I can't say I'm too surprised by the results. A lot of of Undergrads as I had expected. I am a bit surprised, however, by the lack of parents. I've seen parents on this subreddit before, but no one responded as one. Goes to show that the bigger the audience- the more accurate. Pretty interesting stuff anyhow.

.......................................................................

**To Conclude**

The survey went well and had some pretty cool results. I'd like to thank all those that participated, as the data grew more resemblance to the true construction of the subreddit as more people responded. Thank you :)

A fun fact: 3 different people completed the survey in just 4 seconds. 4! I knew it would be quick but damn! You guys (79% of you as we know now), and girls (21%) are quick.

 Any ideas why r/cornell has such a small user base? - Given that Cornell Students are pretty close to the majority demographic of reddit users, I'm surprised at how small this subreddit is. Especially if you consider that a good chunk might be Alumni at this point. Any ideas? Found out I have to have a dry Slope Day because I just got mono. -  Could the nor' easter cause class/prelim cancellations? - I always hear snow has never resulted in class being cancelled. Just wondering what the chances are.  Overwatch event this Saturday (tomorrow) - Since reddit and gaming have a pretty big overlap, I just thought I'd let everyone know there is an Overwatch event happening tomorrow at 1pm in 318 Phillips.

Great classes at Cornell? - I'm an incoming freshman and I thought it would be really cool if people posted about the most impactful or fun classes they've taken at Cornell Looking back, what do you wish you knew going into Cornell freshman year? - I'm going to be a freshman next fall and was just curious if anyone had some advice they wish they knew going in as a freshman. Any replies are greatly appreciated. Spring Day was an annual celebration at Cornell University, 1900. -  In your experience, how much has the Cornell "brand" helped in terms of connections and job placement? - I'm most interested in pursuing computer science, business/finance, or medicine, so any information specific to those three fields would be extremely helpful. 

I guess I have 3 main inquiries regarding opportunities from going to Cornell:

1) How big is the entrepreneurial spirit at Cornell? How does it compare to those found at Stanford and MIT? Is it easy to find capable people who want to create tech startups for example?

2) How much have you benefited connections-wise by going to Cornell? How does it compare to schools like Harvard and Yale?

3) How well generally have employers regarded your Cornell degree/education? How much of a "wow" factor does it have compared to the likes of Harvard, Princeton, etc.?

**P.S:** Just so we're clear, I am not coming at this from a negative or skeptical view of Cornell. Personally, I fully realize that I'm incredibly lucky to have been accepted, seeing as I was expecting to go to a mid-tier UC a few months ago. And ultimately I realize that success depends more on the person than the college. I'm just trying to get an honest picture of what to expect at Cornell, and what my parents are going to be investing 200k+ dollars in.  Advice for incoming freshman - Hello Cornellians! 

I was accepted in the ED round and am extremely excited to be attending Cornell in the fall.

All responses wanted! CGSU Admits Defeat in Unionization Vote -  The Housing Lottery + Living Off Campus [Megathread] - We've been getting a lot of questions about the housing lottery and living off campus lately, so I thought we'd have a centralized place to put those in order to avoid repeating questions. There's general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here!

**Housing FAQ**

* ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?***

I'll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low. 

* ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?***

Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option. 

* ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?*** 

Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don't find anything you like there, Googling "Cornell Apartments" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.

Sorry for the shakiness in the beginning. We're #2 - Where America's Top CEOs Went to School -  6 days until Slope Day. Time to start practicing. -  oh god NO -  The Nashville Predators have stolen all of Lynah's hockey chants! - Sarcasm, of course. But look at the similarities!

https://section303.com/ Since July 2000, Cornell's Lake Source Cooling has saved an average of 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year versus previous cooling methods -  Incoming freshman questions - Hi! I've committed to Cornell (so excited!!! please let me leave high school already) and I know it's a bit early, but I just wanted to get an idea of what I'll do there.
For reference, I was admitted to CAS and I'm planning to major in Physics. I think I'll minor in CS, but I'm not too sure about that.

1. I have a 5 in AP Calc BC and I'm confident in my calc ability,
but I don't know if I should take MATH 2230 because I don't have a complete background in multi (studying now)  or linear algebra. Would it be more reasonable for me to take 2210?

2. I'm majoring in physics because I want to do astronomy.
Would it be better for me to hold off on introductory astronomy courses until later or should I take them ASAP?

3. Any must-take classes to fulfill requirements or just because they're fun.
I don't want to overload on classes, though, so I have room to explore.

4. How's Balch Hall? My parents are a bit overprotective so they made me sign up for the women's dorm and put a single as my first choice lol.

5. Since I might get a single, what should I bring?
I've been thinking of getting a printer, but I don't want to waste my money.

6. Where should I buy clothing? I'm from SoCal so I'm totally inexperienced with the snow and I'm not buying winter clothes here lol.
I know good boots are a must.

7. Where to eat? I'm probably getting the meal plan with 10 swipes and $500 BRBs because I heard that most people eat lunch outside of the dining halls and I don't really eat breakfast.

Any other recommendations are welcome. Thank you in advance! Best date locations on campus? - Any opinions on nice date opportunities? 

Casual vs. fancy? Scenic vs. social?

Wanted to hear other opinions. Thanks! How to meet more artsy kids at Cornell - I'm a pretty outgoing guy who loves to party; however, I did not pledge because I cannot really stand greek life. With all my friends now engaged w/ that, I am now having trouble finding more likeminded people. how does one go about meeting the more artsy kids at cornell?  Why is it so easy to transfer into Cornell? - I'm not trying to look down on transfers. But for the state endowed colleges, I've read about a few students with low gpas in high school (speaking 2.7s...) who managed to get As in community college and transferred in after just a year (one person transferred after a semester) with no extracurriculars and just nothing...

And some of these transfers aren't just... prepared for Cornell? I know a transfer who is in ILR and thinks it is an extremely hard major (this person is getting Ds on exams when the medians are B+s and A-s...). 

Therefeore, what is the point of trying so hard in high school just to have this happen? I'm not looking down on anyone who's a transfer, some of them are the smartest people I know and some ended up with the guaranteed transfer. But I just don't get why Cornell lets in so many people who are just not qualified. Is it for their tuition money? Like I just don't get it Sooo im a dumbass and got pulled over today for reckless driving, a criminal misdemeanor. Could I get kicked out or lose financial aid eligibility because of this? - So I just got home today from finals, finally stress free, and went out with friends in my car to be dumb and have some fun. We found an empty parking lot and I started doing some donuts. By started i mean literally half a donut, then get lit up by an undercover cop car that was parked on the other side of the lot. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes, ya I know you don't need to tell me. 

I still need to go to court and hopefully it could get reduced to something less than reckless driving, which is a criminal misdemeanor and I would have a criminal record. If it doesn't get reduced though, could cornell find out about this and could they expel me or some other consequences? I can't really find any info online. 

Really would not be good to fuck up my future over something this stupid. Gay Scene - How's the gay dating/hookup scene at Cornell? Is it hard to finding a gay guy to date?
