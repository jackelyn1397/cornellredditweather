CORNELL BEATS HARVARD. LETS GO RED -  Joe Biden to be 2017 Convocation Speaker -  HARVARD SUCKS -  Bojack Horseman just referenced Ithaca! -  Kyle the cat is HOME! - Hello everyone! I posted awhile back about my sister's cat "Kyle" who had hitched a ride allll the from Cortland to Ithaca in a car (unbeknownst to the driver) and made his exit in the Fall Creek neighborhood.  After 9 days of countless hours and walking God knows how many miles of searching, WE GOT HIM!!!  Thank you all for your support and concern!   After coming back from break... -  The golden book from the gif at the top of r/interestingasfuck is from the Cornell Library -  anyone else extremely disappointed with the Cornell Admissions AMA? - recent alumni here. there were some really thoughtful questions that went unanswered. in fact, the admissions committee only answered like 4 or 5 questions total! Upset because I think it makes the school look worse than having never done the AMA at all. 

EDIT: looks like they'll be back on today to answer a few more questions! hopefully a redemption is in the making Martha E. Pollack, provost at Michigan, named 14th president -  So excited to be admitted! Can't believe I'm going to an Ivy League School! -  Sunrise over the B-lot yesterday morning -  Took a 360 degree panorama from the clock tower yesterday and thought I'd share. -  PSA to prefrosh: why cornell is going to be better than ever - welcome incoming freshmen! youre probably pretty pumped and i wanted to add to that by saying that cornell feels like a more accommodating place for new/continuing students than its ever been. 

some things off the top of my head: 

- as mentioned in another post, uber/lyft are now allowed in upstate NY which means that you can get a ride to go to target, wegmans, the airport or wherever you want really. without a car back in the day (lol) people had to rely on TCAT to get around town which ran irregularly and was a pain to carry bags or groceries on. 

- big red bikes means that if youre an engineer living in the townhouses or a food science major living on west your life is about to get a LOT easier. downside is incoming students wont get to know every crack in the sidewalk on east ave or tower road but I think you guys will get over it

- greenstar is in collegetown!! its been open for a little while now but before this people would have to either bus to wegmans (at least 3 hours total) or settle for the stuff at 7 eleven

- anabels grocery is supposed to be opening this summer. if walking to ctown was too far and youd still like to cook then you can get your groceries right on campus. a lot if not all of the produce is local and prices are apparently very reasonable

- safety improvements. i know that prospective students might have read about the rash of assaults in ithaca that have occurred over the past year, which was out of the norm, but i wanted to point out that cornell has been trying to make campus safer. new lighting installed on the slope, i believe more blue lights as well, and the big red shuttle will ferry students around campus from 12 to 3 am on weekends. 

- fancy new vending machines in the dorms means you can buy headphones or tylenol or whatever on the go instead of having to trudge all the way to the cornell store in the snow come winter or off-campusand no longer have to deal with getting everything shipped to you via amazon.  

- general lack of construction. i think most of the new apartments in collegetown will be finished by this fall as will the MBA center, and upson should be renovated by then as well. the ag quad will also be newly refurbished. schwartz performing arts center will have a new seating area and patio out front. regardless of what youre studying youll probably get to spend a significant amount of time in at least one state-of-the-art new building.

A lot of this will sound obvious. Well, fuck you, because I didn't know this shit as a 17 year old straight-laced tightwad nerd who was getting his first taste of freedom.

(For reference, I'm now a 27 year old tightwad nerd... though much less straight laced and probably a little drunk).

**Academics**

* Get used to not being the smartest person in the room. It's okay. It just means that, *gasp*, you have something to learn.
* Ask for help if you need it. Seriously. Don't be an asshole like I was and think "it's weak to ask for help because I never needed it in HS."
* Go to class. Every single fucking class. And study. Most of the stress people end up having is from not doing well. The stress of studying is easy in comparison.
* Find out what kind of worker you are: I'm only effective with lots of structure and scheduling, and deadlines to keep me on track. I didn't learn that until after I made a really stupid, lazy roster. Take the first semester to learn how to be effective, and apply it the rest of your 4 years.
* Be smart about how much you can reasonably handle per semester. Yes, you're a full time student, but you need time to unwind, too.
* If you are a gamer, your room is the WORST place to study. Go outside, or to a library, or to CTB, or anywhere. Just not in front of your computer and its sweet, sweet Counterstrike.
* Learn to swim over the summer if you don't know already. CU actually has really fun gym class options, and it sucks to have to spend a semester learning how to swim when you can be rock climbing/pistol shooting/archery-ing/riding horses instead.

**Social Stuff**

* At orientation, you'll lots of people. It's exciting. One of them may even touch your boner (or lady boner). So, be friendly - but also be realistic. Finding people you click with takes effort, so yes, you have to put your best foot forward and get out there, but that doesn't mean latching onto the first person who tolerates you. Be upbeat, have something to offer everyone, and really feel people out from the perspective of whether you really enjoy spending your time with them.
* Talk to everyone. You don't have to be best friends with everyone, but introduce yourself. Ask them about what they like. Listen. You're going to meet people from places you've never been who grew up in ways you never did. Learn and, when possible, have fun with them.
* Start a dinner group. Even just two people. It's therapeutic.
* DO NOT HAVE YOUR FIRST DRUNKEN EXPERIENCE WITH PEOPLE YOU HAVEN'T KNOWN LONG ENOUGH TO TRUST WITH YOUR LIFE. Teenagers have no fucking clue on how to take care of a drunk. So, yeah, have a drink or two, but don't give into shot pressure if you know you suck at drinking (or have no idea how much you can drink). Also, medical amnesty - if you pass out, call the fucking EMTs. People die when they ignore this.
* When you first throw up and get your first hangover, don't be the dick who says "I'm never drinking again." Just suck it up, drink some gatorade, brush your teeth and walk it of. Your liver will be taking much more punishment in the next four years.
* I found that the best way to meet people I clicked with was through activities - so make sure you check out the club fairs, and try a lot of things out the first couple weeks. After that, stick around for what ACTIVITY you enjoy most. Trust me, you'll build much stronger friendships if you follow your passion, rather than just joining something because the people seem cool to you.
* On that note, join the ballroom dance team *cough cough.*

**Dorms and Roommates**

* Good boundaries are key, and unless you both grew up responsible enough to never need your parents to clean up after you, you have shitty boundaries. No problem, but always remember that in any dispute, *you might be the asshole in that scenario.*
* Be a person of your word. Be prepared to split chores, and even do some things that you dislike, because your roommate will also be doing things he or she dislikes. It beats being passive aggressive and hating the hours you have to spend in your room because you're not allowed to sleep anywhere else.
* That said, even when your roommate situation is great, less time in your room is best for everyone who lives there.
* Sexile is not completely off-limits as long as you call ahead, and make it worth your roommate's while. He or she will be doing you a solid, so either be prepared to reciprocate in some way or don't do it.
* It's not where you live, it's what you make of it. I know more people who are still friends/in touch from Donlon 6 today than from any other dorm I've ever heard of.
* On that note, just because you're living in the same building as someone doesn't make it more likely for you to end up as good friends. Hang around people because you like them not because it's easy.
* If you piss on the seat, clean it, or vigilante justice IS warranted. 

**Dating**

* This is for guys and girls. Don't rush into or out of relationships. College is a different ball field, yes, but that doesn't mean you should just go all in or all out. This is one of the few times in your life when it's really completely cool to just be unattached - where no one will be in your business and making you feel like an asshole or a slut for dating lots of people (okay, some people may still do that. But, none of them is writing you a paycheck, so fuck 'em). At the same time, don't just bail on a good situation just because you can. You'll stunt your growth in relationships in either extreme.
* For the love of god, people, if someone wants to spend time with you, they will make it as easy as possible. If you have to call someone 5 times for them to even answer, they don't wanna hang out with you, holmes. Sorry.
* Nice clothes (non-college bum couture) goes a pretty long way in making you noticeable.
* Never, ever date someone just because the sex is good. Make that person a FWB. And don't be ashamed of that arrangement. It's actually kind of awesome.
* If you're a virgin, it's cool. Lots of people willing to let you practice.
* If you want to stay a virgin, that's cool too. There are lots of people who are doing the same thing.

**Cornelliana that I personally really loved**

* Go to your corny floor events. Go to the corny dances. Go to all of the things, at least to stop by and see it. You'll miss it after you've graduated.
* Go gorge jumping. There's only a short period of time when it's actually warm enough on campus to do. Make sure you a) know how to swim, and b) are with someone who knows how to get to the jump points.
* You gotta go to at least ONE frat party. I'm a party animal, and even then frat parties weren't my thing (too many people I didn't know) - but I never would have known that and then learned to throw my own parties if I didn't try one.
* Risley is pretty fuckin' cool. If they still have it, ask about pool. Or a Balch run. Also, go to at least one Rocky Horror picture show.
* Cornell cinema regularly shows films that you might never see anywhere else. Check it out.
* Buy an article of Cornell clothing. There are so many of us in the world that I'm always surprised by how much Cornell gear I see out there - instant connection. 
* Slope Day. Forever and always.

**Other Thoughts**

* Ithaca ruins shoes. Bring sturdy snow boots. That's all you'll hear me say about the weather. Can we please have a rule against admission threads? - The questions and answers for these threads are always the exact same. OP: "Here's my GPA, activities resume, etc. What are my chances of getting in?" Commenters: "We're not admissions officers; there's no way of telling. Just apply and good luck." It's redundant to say the least any time a thread like this is posted. The purpose of the subreddit is for people to talk about the ongoings of Cornell, events at the college, class questions, and the like. If you hop on over to /r/Harvard right now you can see that admissions posts aren't allowed there because they were plagued by these crappy threads to the point it was unbearable, and we shouldn't have to wait until we get to that point. Literally all of these questions could be better answered by a simple google search or post on College Confidential.

TL;DR: Admissions questions are pointless and fill up the front page with redundant questions and answers; let's get rid of them. Today I went to Wegman's for the first time.  This was my reaction. -  Six Cornellians Slated To Compete in 2016 Rio Olympics -  Prelim Depression Reaccs Only -  Chapter House Destroyed: Devastating Fire Sweeps Stewart Ave. -  Checkmate Harvard! -  Incoming First-Gen Cornell Student Found Dead in the Ithaca Falls Gorge -  Google giving Cornell University 22k square feet of free office space at its NYC HQ for 5 years -  I urge everyone to spend a summer in Ithaca - Just an alumnus stopping by to recommend spending a summer in Ithaca. Ithaca is beautiful during the summer and there is so much to do outside (parks, hanging out near the water etc). Without the stress of classes and the copious amounts of students you get to know Ithaca a little better as well.

Summer lovin' - As a recent Cornell alumnus, I remember fondly enjoying the hiking and flora around Ithaca and campus. However, there really is no more appropriate way to celebrate a visit to Cornell than to find a secluded meadow or glen and make sweet whoopee.

Any particularly good locations around, say, the plantations?

Sincerley,
Definitely not Cornell PD How it feels staying in Ithaca for the summer. -  Having a really hard time - hey all. i'm a freshman engineer and i've really been struggling with adjusting to cornell. i got rejected from all of the project teams i applied to, i feel like i'm the stupidest person in all of my classes, i have no time for extracurriculars, and most of all, i feel like i have no friends. i'm just feeling terrible and i wanted to turn to you guys for reassurance and/or advice, because this really sucks  I'm totally lost. - I'm going to be a senior in Computer Science and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do after I graduate. Now this may be a common problem, but I think if I have deeper issues because I get incredibly depressed at the thought of working in an office environment at a cubicle. It feels incredibly stifling and monotonous to me. 

I had an internship at a Fortune 500 company last summer that I really disliked, and I quit my internship at that same company 2 weeks into this summer because I just couldn't pull through mentally. To be honest, I only majored in CS because my parents told me to. I haven't enjoyed it at all. And frankly I attended Cornell because my parents told me to as well; otherwise, I most likely would have just gone to my highly regarded state school (they did pay for my education in full though, which I'm incredibly grateful for).

I've always liked the thought of owning my own business. There's this new building in a shopping plaza that opened up near my house.  Every time I walk by I always think to myself how great it would be if I were to run a business in a space like that. But I don't have any idea as to WHAT that business would entail.  

And of course, even if I did have an idea as to what that business would be, it's incredibly risky to pursue something like that and forgo traditional employment. Am I just lazy? Depressed? Naive? I just can't seem to come up with what I'd like to end up doing if I weren't running my own thing. I will be going to career services when I get on campus, but from what I've heard, they aren't particularly helpful. 

Meanwhile, my classmates seem to be enjoying their highly paid internships in New York City, Bay Area, etc, and all I've done is sit at home trying to make sense of things. Does anybody have advice for someone who just feels incredibly lost and hopeless?  What the fuck... - So this flier was posted in r/wtf

Someone then found his website and it says the following in a blogpost: 
"I can do some touring for a few months at least right now. Maybe even 5-6 months. I'm thinking about maybe joining the military in 2014 by summer. I've sort of had that fantasy since 2008 now, after times got tough. I figure in the long term, "order" won't hurt me, where this country is headed. I'm on the road, driving. **I'm headed to CU, B. Hall, in I, NY.** Them are initials for something. Figure it out. I'm serious."

what Getting used to not liking college - Title pretty much sums it up. Cornell is meh. Lots of work. Isolated place, lots of competition, little time for socializing. Sophomore CS.

You know, this year I said I would socialize more and it's been fun and all, but my grades have suffered, my sleep schedule is garbanzo beans, and I don't even think I'm any happier.

That said, I'm used to it at this point. My high school friends are having a blast at their lib arts schools. We out here tho.

 Happy Birthday Ezra Cornell!!! - I see the balloons, does anyone know where the cake cutting ceremony will be? See you August 2016, Cornell! -  Search fails to find Cornell student; memorial planned Monday night -  unbearably lonely - I'm a new sophomore transfer, and I'm really struggling socially- it's been two months and I don't have a single friend. I didn't have friends at my old school (or high school...), and I really hoped that Cornell would be a fresh start and I would finally "find my people". I joined clubs that I'm interested in, I talked to people during orientation, but nothing really panned out and now I feel like everyone has settled into a routine and isn't actively looking for new friends.

I know that I have a lot of underlying social anxiety/self esteem issues that are holding me back, so I'm trying to figure out how to get through that. Therapy was something my parents wanted me to look into when I was having similar problems at my old school, so I called Cornell Health counseling last week, but they told me it would be over a month before I could make an appointment. I don't want to go to EARS or any of that bullshit, but I don't know what my other options are.

I can feel myself slipping back into the same depressive cycle I was in last year, and while I really don't want that to happen I don't know how to prevent it. Seeing everyone with their friends at homecoming and halloween parties makes me want to cry because I feel like I'll never get to have those experiences.

:( Cornell's very first student-run record label is having their first big release February 28th - Kurt Riley's new album, "Kismet." - [Electric Buffalo Records](https://www.facebook.com/electricbuffalorecords/) is a student-run label, operating under the purview of the Cornell Media Guild. We hold our meetings at WVBR-FM, near where the old Chapter House stood. The main goal of EBR is to give Cornell students and Ithaca residents a chance to get their music out to a wider audience, through iTunes, Spotify, and traditional networks like radio and print articles.

Since Electric Buffalo Records started last spring, many Cornellians have gotten involved - photographers, musicians, producers, you name it. One of the most active participants has been [Kurt Riley](https://www.facebook.com/kurtrileymusic/), a Cornell senior whose "[scintillating brand of glam/new wave/punk rock that will excite you about the direction of contemporary music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyVF25VEx0)" 

EBR is very excited about his new album, "Kismet." All of the musicians are Cornell students and Ithaca residents, and it was recorded right on campus - in Lincoln Hall and inside Carl Becker House. The first music video from the album, for the song "[Hush Hush Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZHwtbLL8ME)," was shot at the Johnson Museum and in the Commons. Through the entire process of making the record, Kurt Riley has been able to work with some of Cornell's most talented students.

For Chemistry 2090, my final grade was soooooo much lower than I expected, and that real destroyed my GPA. Now I know this will put me under poor academic standing, so what will happen next? I passed all my classes, and in particular I got a D, C, C, B-. For next semester, I really fixed my schedule so that I can appropriate a more efficient pattern of studying and sleeping, and I have already started to study for my next semester classes. I am not at all worried or scared and I know that I can fix all of my mistakes from this semester in my next semester. However, in the long wrong, how will this affect me? I successfully managed to join a very top project team and have good other extracurricular activities. Thanks! Cornell: New women's rowing shell to be named for President Garrett -  How did you meet some of your closer friends at Cornell? (from a lonely freshman) - Hi,

I realize it's still very early into college, and clubs are the best way to meet people, but I'm feeling a bit hopeless. I came from a big NYC high school that has a large representation here but I only talk to ~4 of them, and we're not that close. Also they all know each other well so I feel excluded from that group.

I do talk to some people who live near me but they're in Hotel/Architecture while I'm in Engineering (CS major btw) so we can't see each other that often. I talked to a lot of people during orientation, but I didn't find a lot that had common interests with me (I guess that's what clubs are for?) I haven't been able to talk to people in my classes, and everyone already seems to have friends that they eat/walk with. 

I feel overwhelmed and miserable, and I feel a lot more pressure to find friends/hang out with people than I did back home (where I did have a good group of friends that has now scattered). 

I guess what I'm asking is, do you have any advice with dealing with this? Is there anything I can do until or even after the club fair? Any stories relating to this? I'm not too into parties btw.

TLDR: Having trouble making friends, especially in my college/major. Need advice.

Mud Rush on the Ag Quad, Cornell, 1922. -  RESULTS: "What is You Relationship with Cornell" - Survey - **Some Background:**

About 2 days ago I posted a thread linking to a survey regarding the relationship the users of this sub have with the University itself. The response was pretty positive and it seemed like people wanted the results so- here they are!

Now, I know that this survey only only represents a small portion of the sub (142 out of 2,245), but I feel it at least gives a general insight as to who makes up the place. Also, I did keep it up for over two days, so most active users and frequenters probably did have the chance to partake, meaning that the people who post the most and visit the most are represented best. I personally believe this to be a good thing. 

Now for the results:

Female|30|21%

^^*Percents ^^are ^^rounded

For every *1* female there are *3.7* males

For every *1* male there are *.27* females

Wow. I did not expect it to be this uneven. Men generally use Reddit more, but this contrast is pretty extreme. I'm curious as to why this occurred. Can't argue with the data though.

Undergraduate Students make up almost half of the results

No one responded as "Professor" 

No one responded as "Parent of a Student"

"Others" included:

* Professional Student

*  Ithacan

* PostDoc

...and more

*-*

I can't say I'm too surprised by the results. A lot of of Undergrads as I had expected. I am a bit surprised, however, by the lack of parents. I've seen parents on this subreddit before, but no one responded as one. Goes to show that the bigger the audience- the more accurate. Pretty interesting stuff anyhow.

.......................................................................

**To Conclude**

The survey went well and had some pretty cool results. I'd like to thank all those that participated, as the data grew more resemblance to the true construction of the subreddit as more people responded. Thank you :)

A fun fact: 3 different people completed the survey in just 4 seconds. 4! I knew it would be quick but damn! You guys (79% of you as we know now), and girls (21%) are quick.

Comments anyone?   Is there a place on campus where I can learn new instruments? - I doubt this exists but thought I might as well ask!

I'm not musically talented but like to learn new creative skills to destress.. are there any organizations, clubs, or classes that teach instruments to beginners? I'm interested in percussions, guitar, piano, or even learning to handle studio equipments! (Not so much wind instruments at the moment)

We were also considering changing the venue, but it looks like the weather is going to cooperate and so we're planning to have the meetup in my backyard so we can use the grill/fire pit out back.

i mean i understand why they hold these network sessions but its just so awkward and I just can't see how it's comfortable having all these people crowd around you Overwatch event this Saturday (tomorrow) - Since reddit and gaming have a pretty big overlap, I just thought I'd let everyone know there is an Overwatch event happening tomorrow at 1pm in 318 Phillips.

Get tickets here. -  Are there actually good ways to get help on campus? - The past year or so has really not been going super well for me and I'm at the point where I don't feel like I can deal with my problems anymore. I want to know if someone can help without making things worse. I've had friends deal with Cornell's mental health system in the past and they just got sent home for a semester and that didn't really seem to help them much and I don't think prolonging this another year is actually going to help what's been stressing me, so I'd rather avoid ending up like that if possible, but I also don't want to waste my time just chatting with someone who's just going to give me nonsense advice like trying to be positive. I'm already stressed about all the stuff I have to do, so throwing away more time doesn't seem useful. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. It's 5 in the morning and I got no sleep tonight between my cold and my freaking out about all the class I've missed on top of all my other problems. I can't just keep going on like this and end up being fine with my classes, but I can't think of a way to help this problem that doesn't involve me just repeating the process again a year later. It's not even just the work that's the issue, but it certainly doesn't help to feel like I don't even have the time to think about and deal with these problems properly.

Tier | FA13-SP14 Cap | FA14-SP15 Cap | % Difference
---|---|----|----
Tier 1 | $16500 | $15000 | -9.1%
Tier 2 | $11000 | $10000 | -10%
Tier 3 | $9000 | $8000 | -11%
Tier 4 | $7000 | $6000 | -14%
Tier 5 | $5000 | $4000 | -20%
Tier 6 | $3000 | $2000 | -33%
Sources: [2013-2014 allocations](https://orgsync.com/90113/files/592407/show), [2014-2015 tier caps](https://orgsync.com/90113/files/592720/show) (pg 3)

The cuts hit the lower tier clubs especially hard--if you are in a small tier 6 club, your funding cap has been lowered by 1/3rd this year.

Quick background on me - I came in as a sophomore year transfer but stayed an extra year due to changing majors, and ended up getting full 4 years of experience as a Big Red. I majored in ORIE in the engineering school and currently am working my dream job, having a blast.

There's general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here!

**Housing FAQ**

* ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?***

I'll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low. 

* ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?***

Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option. 

* ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?*** 

Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don't find anything you like there, Googling "Cornell Apartments" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.

Soph transfer here, I'm struggling a lot with adapting to cornell (not in the academic sense).

Backstory: I've struggled with depression for many years now and the biggest thing affecting me is a total lack of motivation. I had an awful experience at my previous uni and I thought coming to Cornell would help, but it hasn't. It has prevented me from functioning correctly (i.e. im too depressed/have no motivation to apply for jobs, spend time with friends, join clubs, etc.) 

When I went to Clubfest i had this same problem. I had no motivation to join any of the clubs and I would be forcing myself to join if i did. However, 2 clubs actually caught my eye and interested me a lot (something that rarely happens nowadays). I poured my heart and soul into preparing for their tryouts (again, something I rarely do) and both of them rejected me, and its been hitting me REALLY hard. I've lost the sliver of motivation I had when trying out for these clubs and everything feels mechanical. It feels devastating knowing my best isn't good enough for either of them (and one of these clubs I did in HS for 2 years, so I thought I would do well enough...)

I do go to counseling sessions at CHealth, but other people don't really understand. They tell me things like "just join other clubs", but i physically cannot force myself to join a club I have no motivation to pursue. Any advice for what to do next? I am still not a member of any clubs, and I feel massive guilt for not doing anything on campus.

If you've made it to this point, thank you :) Rushing/Hazing at Fraternities - Can anyone speak on what people have to do when they are getting hazed? How intense is it, for how long? Examples?
