It's the most wonderful time of the year -  HARVARD SUCKS -  Cornell Basic Boys Starter Pack -  Cornell Basic Girls Starter Pack -  After coming back from break... -  Prosecutor charges Cornell student with hate crime -  anyone else extremely disappointed with the Cornell Admissions AMA? - recent alumni here. there were some really thoughtful questions that went unanswered. in fact, the admissions committee only answered like 4 or 5 questions total! Upset because I think it makes the school look worse than having never done the AMA at all. 

EDIT: looks like they'll be back on today to answer a few more questions! hopefully a redemption is in the making Quiet place to study in Collegetown - Need a good place to study? St. Luke Church (right next to CTB) is OPEN TO ALL for quiet study now through Wednesday Dec 14, 10am to Midnight (Sundays  1pm to Midnight). Wireless available throughout the building. FREE coffee and tea (and usually snacks). People are welcome to bring your own food and there are several small group study rooms available. No proselytizing, just supporting our college community by offering up the space for those in need.  Martha E. Pollack, provost at Michigan, named 14th president -  To every anxious applicant to Cornell looking for advice/chances... - Yes, you have a chance. No, we don't know what it is. No, that doesn't disqualify you. Yes, that thing matters. No, that thing isn't the only thing that matters. Yes, Cornell is cold. No, youwait, you were arrested for what?

&nbsp;

Everybody here is really glad that Cornell is your first, or second, or third, or eighty sixth choice. We all hope that you become a part of our world, and as much as we make fun of them, we also really love new Freshman. 

&nbsp;

You all have a ton of anxiety regarding college admissions right now. You might get in, you might not, none of us really have any idea as we don't sit on the admissions board. But something to remember when you're posting here and on CC and agonizing over GPA percentiles and ACT scores, the college you attend does not matter nearly as much as how you take advantage of every opportunity given to you.

&nbsp;

Not only that, you also have to remember to just live and be free. Do something stupid. Do a lot of things fun. Make art and be happy. You have the rest of your life to be worried about things much more important than what college you are admitted to.

&nbsp;

You've probably read this same message a billion times. There is a reason. Listen to it.

We know most of you are already at Cornell, but we see quite a few prospective students coming here to ask for advice about applying to Cornell, so we thought we'd hold an AMA on Tuesday, December 8th. If you're already a Cornellian, we'd love your upvotes for visibility on Tuesday at the AMA over at r/iama. If you're a prospective student, get your admissions questions ready!

We saw an imposter Cornell Admissions post the other day, so we thought we should give some actual admissions advice to Redittors who aspire to become Cornellians. 

We'll be providing lots of proof, so you know it's us. We're frequent lurkers of this sub and you all do a great job representing Cornell, especially sharing what it's like to be a student at Cornell, so thanks for that!

 Imagine how great it would be if we could get the thousands of Cornellians subscribed to their respective classes' facebook pages to migrate over here where people can get answers to their questions more easily and discuss campus ongoings anonymously.       
                     
This sub has consistently given me invaluable knowledge about Cornell ranging from schedules to party life and everything in between, and I wish more people at Cornell could get that knowledge if they so desired to. 
    
 I don't know exactly what it would take, but show your friends the subreddit and get them subscribed if they have a reddit account; if they don't, encourage them to make one so they can sign up. Mods, communicate with the owners of Cornell "Class of ___ " facebook pages and see if you can advertise this sub on all those pages. Hell, if some of you are ambitious enough even print out quarter cards or hang up fliers in your residence halls.
        
 In short, this sub is a great resource run by actual students and offers advice and experiences that you really just can't get from academic advisors, professors, etc. and I wish more Cornellians knew about it. So even if it means just getting one friend to subscribe here, we should all try to grow this sub.

Great news!
 Cornell Weather 101: Cornell cold weather for those with little to no experience - Ok everyone. You might have heard bad things about the weather, have experienced northern cold once or twice, or you might just question "how bad could it be?" Here's the answer you're looking for. I'll try to give you the actual numbers, the intuition of how cold works and how to fight it, and recommendation and rules for buying clothes.

**1) [Click Here For the Weather Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)

**2) Here is my commentary on the weather data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.

**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign to some, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on a talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.

Ok, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.

But here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands. Another big things that make a difference is movement/exercise. Walking in the sun vs sitting in the shade can be the difference of 15 to 20 degrees.

Try this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is becauseand I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a "the human body is awesome" kind of waythat little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.

**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. If you are prepared, you feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas, just with more clothes on. As the Swedes say: "there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing." This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.

First, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just a sweater (for the legs it is long underwear). Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.

Other things to think about:

* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.

* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.

* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.

* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.

* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see "goose down 600". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.

**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.

* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, customer support, and everything from them is machine washable. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).

* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.

* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.

* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.

* If you don't wear glasses, buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1428097222&sr=8-3&keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20. If you do, spend the greatest $10 of your life and upgrade to [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Howler-Windproof-Balaclava/dp/B002ZG7RGC/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1428097222&sr=8-6&keywords=balaclava), which seems to have better ventilation based on the reviews.

 Internet romance blooms over Cornell Confessions website (a bit long, but worth the read) -  A message to all the ED applicants - If you got accepted, congratulations! 

If you didn't get accepted, it is very easy to feel terrible, but you really shouldn't(especially if Cornell was your first choice). Here are a couple of points to consider. 

* If you didn't get accepted, it does not mean you are stupid. There is always a small percentage of people who get accepted but will do bad, and a percentage of people who doesn't get accepted but could have done well. Also, schools consider more things than the ''intelligence factors'' (i.e. SAT/ACT score, GPA). 

* If you didn't get into Cornell, don't think you won't get accepted in any other more prestigious schools. I, for example, got rejected from UCSD (35.9% acceptance rate), but got admitted here (14% acceptance rate). 

* The college you go won't determine your life. Sure, going to a prestigioss school gives you more resources and will make life easier, but that does not mean that if you don't get in you won't get the job you've always dreamt of. It will simply be a little bit harder.

tl;dr: college application is not a perfect science. Don't feel bad if you got rejected. Congratulations if you did get accepted! Flora Rose House slowly transforms into one of the Gothics...  -  Great things about Cornell? - Hey, I just got admitted to Cornell, and I'm really considering going. One thing though that bothers me is that most of the posts I've read from r/Cornell during the last half-hour or so have been really really negative. Mostly concerning housing and the very high workload.

 So, how is it really? What are some great things about Cornell? Cornell Varsity Crew, 1911.

## What's different?
Pretty much everything has received a visual facelift. The flair, the content, the imagery, the colors, everything's more Cornell related. 

## Flair
Everyone now has the ability to set their own flair, prefixed with a few options based on the different Cornell programs and some locales that I thought people might like. At this time there's no ability to set your own prefix, though I'm working on a way to do that.

It would be amazing if someone could photocopy this thesis and send it to me. It's located at the University Annex, which seems to have a system for doing this type of stuff:
https://annex.library.cornell.edu/content/annex-requests-information

This document is clearly in the public domain, having been published between 1923 and 1963 without the copyright being extended in 1989. It's complicated but I can explain via PM; if interested, you can also refer here:

Anyways, if someone would be willing to photocopy this document and send it to me so that I don't have to travel all the way to Ithaca, I'd gladly pay $40. I'm happy to provide all the documentation and verification you'd need so that you know I'm legit.

Thanks!

(EDITED - to add more information) Important question about Cornell WiFi - As an incoming freshman, I am very excited to go to Cornell Arts and Sciences. One question about the wifi, can I watch porn freely there? Will any IT people kick my dorm door down and shame me?

There's an underlying tone that they really do wish they could and I'm not particularly exempt from that either. But all in all, it feels casual and normal.

Is this a normal thing at Cornell or at any college? I've thought it was normal and fine since Cornell is stressful but is this actually not okay? Someone told me I just need to suck it up and deal with it since this is college and I also accepted that but after thinking about it I'm not sure if I should try talking to someone or just like the person say, it's normal and just deal with it. Cornell's very first student-run record label is having their first big release February 28th - Kurt Riley's new album, "Kismet." - [Electric Buffalo Records](https://www.facebook.com/electricbuffalorecords/) is a student-run label, operating under the purview of the Cornell Media Guild. We hold our meetings at WVBR-FM, near where the old Chapter House stood. The main goal of EBR is to give Cornell students and Ithaca residents a chance to get their music out to a wider audience, through iTunes, Spotify, and traditional networks like radio and print articles.

Since Electric Buffalo Records started last spring, many Cornellians have gotten involved - photographers, musicians, producers, you name it. One of the most active participants has been [Kurt Riley](https://www.facebook.com/kurtrileymusic/), a Cornell senior whose "[scintillating brand of glam/new wave/punk rock that will excite you about the direction of contemporary music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyVF25VEx0)" 

EBR is very excited about his new album, "Kismet." All of the musicians are Cornell students and Ithaca residents, and it was recorded right on campus - in Lincoln Hall and inside Carl Becker House. The first music video from the album, for the song "[Hush Hush Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZHwtbLL8ME)," was shot at the Johnson Museum and in the Commons. Through the entire process of making the record, Kurt Riley has been able to work with some of Cornell's most talented students.

[Please check out "Kismet" on CDBaby when it comes out February 28th.](http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/KurtRiley1) Support local music and your local record label; Electric Buffalo Records is dedicated to bringing you Cornell's most talented students for years to come - and this is where it all starts!

"The management team of the Big Red Bullet has been looking at the schedule for the holiday period, particularly since both Ithaca College and Cornell are both on prolonged breaks. Since they are our main source of customers, we have decided not to operate for the period 24 December until 2 January, inclusive. 

We regret that you have already made a reservation during that time frame and we regret any inconvenience this may cause. Both Greyhound and Shortline will continue to operate a full schedule between New York and Ithaca.

You will, of course, receive a full reimbursement for the booking you have made."

 Schafer records 400th win as Men's Hockey Coach -  I screwed up my first semester as a Cornell engineer. - Hello reddit, so I finally calculated my GPA for my first fall semester, and it is currently at a 1.87. For Chemistry 2090, my final grade was soooooo much lower than I expected, and that real destroyed my GPA. Now I know this will put me under poor academic standing, so what will happen next? I passed all my classes, and in particular I got a D, C, C, B-. For next semester, I really fixed my schedule so that I can appropriate a more efficient pattern of studying and sleeping, and I have already started to study for my next semester classes. I am not at all worried or scared and I know that I can fix all of my mistakes from this semester in my next semester. However, in the long wrong, how will this affect me? I successfully managed to join a very top project team and have good other extracurricular activities. Thanks!

Cosmos and AMA with Ben Eisenkop, unidan, on Sunday, Plant Sci 233, 8:45 pm - [Announcement Poster](http://i.imgur.com/MB9Bfjm.jpg)

I figure this is the most appropriate place to announce this program, considering our first guest expert.  I'm working with Science Cabaret to bring a program celebrating the 21st century remake and updating of Cosmos.  Cosmos has deep ties to Cornell and the Ithaca community, and it didn't feel right that we were not celebrating it's rebirth here.  Every week we will have a guest expert to comment, provide insight, tell anecdotes, etc., about the episode as we watch it on the big screen in Plant Science 233 (except 3/23 in the Big Red Barn).  There will be a brief interview at 8:45 pm, followed by the show at 9, then concluded with a Q&A (in this case, AMA).

Ben Eisenkop, better known here as /u/unidan, is an enthusiastic proponent of science.  This enthusiasm combined with a seemingly endless knowledge of awesome biological facts has led to him being one of the most famous and beloved users on Reddit.  Cosmos is a public outreach and science enthusiasm program, and this weeks episode features Darwin and Wallace's theory of natural selection.  Ben is a graduate student biologist from Binghamton University, and combined with his commitment to the public promotion of science, makes him a natural and ideal guest to kick off this series.

Please join us in 233 Plant Science this Sunday.  Doors 8:30, interview starts at 8:45.  Free!

Cornell at Columbia on November 15 (12:30PM EST) futurama fry at cornell -  Scumbag Cornell.. -  Median Grade Reports - Remember when Cornell published Median Grade Reports? Well they stopped after Fall 2010, but started putting median grades on our transcripts. Our plan is to create our own Median Grade Reports for Spring 2011 and Fall 2012 based on our transcripts, but we need your help. If everybody follows these steps, we can have full official Median Grade Reports by next week, maybe in time for Add/Drop.

**1)  Order your official transcript  Follow the steps from here** http://transcript.cornell.edu/
This takes 5 minutes, its completely free, and theyll send your official transcript within 2 days

**2) Find your classes on these spreadsheets and enter the MEDIAN grades listed**

**Spring 2011**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj00i2xIYcOIdHp6cmdXRmwwLTVwS2c5Q295WmdXWGc

**Fall 2011**
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj00i2xIYcOIdFBJc0NpcVJPRlRTOEVBOHhldkx1cVE

Use ctrl+f  (command+f on a mac) to find your class number
Keep your own grades private and help out the rest of the Cornell community
 
**3) Tell your friends to do the same thing.** The more people who fill in median grades, the more classes well have median grades for, so spread the word

**4) Look at the median grades for classes you want to take**
 
Thanks a lot everyone for helping out. This is an easy thing to do where everyone benefits. These are the real median grades, and will give everybody more info before signing up for classes. When enough of it has been filled out, well make it a downloadable PDF and put the link here. As an added bonus, once 80% of these classes are filled in, Ill make the median grade reports from Spring 2009  Fall 2010 available for download.

 hey cornell your uni is rad as fuck <3 from australia, i had a great time (and on a tuesday!) -  Ithaca mayor Myrick '09 plans supervised heroin injection facility -  Cornell football wins, beats Columbia 3-0 - In shutout fashion, Cornell won its first game of the season.  Congratulations to Coach Archer and the team -- a home victory at Schoellkopf Field is a good way to break into the win column. RESULTS: "What is You Relationship with Cornell" - Survey - **Some Background:**

About 2 days ago I posted a thread linking to a survey regarding the relationship the users of this sub have with the University itself. The response was pretty positive and it seemed like people wanted the results so- here they are!

Now, I know that this survey only only represents a small portion of the sub (142 out of 2,245), but I feel it at least gives a general insight as to who makes up the place. Also, I did keep it up for over two days, so most active users and frequenters probably did have the chance to partake, meaning that the people who post the most and visit the most are represented best. I personally believe this to be a good thing. 

Now for the results:

Male|112 |79%   
Female|30|21%

^^*Percents ^^are ^^rounded

For every *1* female there are *3.7* males

For every *1* male there are *.27* females

*-*

Wow. I did not expect it to be this uneven. Men generally use Reddit more, but this contrast is pretty extreme. I'm curious as to why this occurred. Can't argue with the data though.

Undergraduate Student| 67 | 47%

Undergraduate Students make up almost half of the results

No one responded as "Professor" 

No one responded as "Parent of a Student"

"Others" included:

* Professional Student

*  Ithacan

* PostDoc

...and more

*-*

I can't say I'm too surprised by the results. A lot of of Undergrads as I had expected. I am a bit surprised, however, by the lack of parents. I've seen parents on this subreddit before, but no one responded as one. Goes to show that the bigger the audience- the more accurate. Pretty interesting stuff anyhow.

.......................................................................

**To Conclude**

The survey went well and had some pretty cool results. I'd like to thank all those that participated, as the data grew more resemblance to the true construction of the subreddit as more people responded. Thank you :)

A fun fact: 3 different people completed the survey in just 4 seconds. 4! I knew it would be quick but damn! You guys (79% of you as we know now), and girls (21%) are quick.

Rick Santorum Protested Off Stage -  In your experience, how much has the Cornell "brand" helped in terms of connections and job placement? - I'm most interested in pursuing computer science, business/finance, or medicine, so any information specific to those three fields would be extremely helpful. 

I guess I have 3 main inquiries regarding opportunities from going to Cornell:

1) How big is the entrepreneurial spirit at Cornell? How does it compare to those found at Stanford and MIT? Is it easy to find capable people who want to create tech startups for example?

2) How much have you benefited connections-wise by going to Cornell? How does it compare to schools like Harvard and Yale?

3) How well generally have employers regarded your Cornell degree/education? How much of a "wow" factor does it have compared to the likes of Harvard, Princeton, etc.?

**P.S:** Just so we're clear, I am not coming at this from a negative or skeptical view of Cornell. Personally, I fully realize that I'm incredibly lucky to have been accepted, seeing as I was expecting to go to a mid-tier UC a few months ago. And ultimately I realize that success depends more on the person than the college. I'm just trying to get an honest picture of what to expect at Cornell, and what my parents are going to be investing 200k+ dollars in.  We made it on Sports Center . . . a little trouble with a big bear -  Ice hockey vs Harvard! - Hi Cornell!  On Friday, February 15, the women's ice hockey team is playing Harvard!  What would it take to get you and your friends to a women's ice hockey game?  

If all goes as expected, Harvard will be ranked #1 in the ECAC, with Cornell a point behind, so a win will help Cornell claim first.  Currently, Harvard and Cornell are #3 and #5, respectively, in the national rankings.

These are some of the best hockey players in the WORLD.  It's fast, physical and a lot of fun to watch.  It would be great to fill Lynah Rink for a women's hockey for the first time ever!!

Finals Schedule published (finally) (I haven't been refreshing since 8:30am) -  Cornell alum startup offers credit line to international students who have no US credit history - Hey guys, a Cornell alum friend of mine started a company [Credit Without Borders](https://www.creditwithoutborders.com) that offers credit cards to international students who otherwise can't get them. I'm throwing their info out there in case any international students on this sub can benefit. 

Aparently, and I didn't know this before, international students have a hard time getting credit cards. Either they don't have a US credit score or social security number. My buddy partnered with a bank and came up with a system to evaluate creditworthiness without a US credit score. It's pretty genius.

Right now they are only accepting students at Cornell, Columbia and NYU over the age of 21.

TA/prof lost my final exam, what to do? - So I took a final around 3 days ago for one of my classes in Statler. It was a hard test, but I thought everyone was struggling anyways, so I handed it in at the podium in front. I distinctly remember even being confused about which pile to put my exam books in, and multiple people (my friends who sat near me) saw me go up, as I finished with around 30 min left. Yesterday, I received an email saying that I turned in the question sheet, but not the exam books. The professor asked me if I went and if there were other people who saw me turn it in. He then offered a retake, but I already left campus. I was trying as hard as possible to seem polite, but I got the feeling that he was getting annoyed, as he said he would just give me an incomplete. The TA also said he looked everywhere, and couldnt find it.
At this point, I have no idea what I should do. I contacted my dean, but she has not responded yet, and Im not sure whether my case is worth arguing, if Im going to have to retake the class anyways. Im a CS major, and I need this class to graduate. Any advice would be appreciated! Cornell hockey video being featured on the front page of /r/hockey! Congrats to Gillam on his first goal! -  Cornell 4 Dartmouth 3 (2OT) - That was stressful. Why doesn't Cornell have a custom reddit icon at the top of the page like the other Ivy reddits? - Edit: 

What do you guys think about this?
http://i.imgur.com/5gC9U.png Any cozy study spots on campus with food? - I found myself really liking OADI and the Asian American Studies Program because they always have snacks/drinks on the ready. Are there any more hidden gems like this on campus? What's going on at the Townhouses? - Bunch of people crowded (and screaming?) around in the Townhouse area. Anyone know what's happening? Just curious.  National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS) at Cornell? - I recently received a letter with an invitation to join NSCS. What is suspicious is the 95 dollar fee.

What's your Cornell pet peeve? -  The Housing Lottery + Living Off Campus [Megathread] - We've been getting a lot of questions about the housing lottery and living off campus lately, so I thought we'd have a centralized place to put those in order to avoid repeating questions. There's general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here!

**Housing FAQ**

* ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?***

I'll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low. 

* ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?***

Housing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option. 

* ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?*** 

Moving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don't find anything you like there, Googling "Cornell Apartments" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around! Your friends have probably also been looking for places, or might know someone who needs an extra person to fill their apartment.

Sorry for the shakiness in the beginning. seeking verification that Irvin Bush taught at Cornell - Hey Cornell,

I'm a College of Charleston student. I've befriended a homeless man here who is strikingly intelligible and well spoken, has friends in all sorts of upper, surprising social circles. He tells me he taught Computer Science at Cornell University before his wife and children were killed by a drunk driver. I'm curious in him and want to believe what he says, am looking for verification. He's 70 years old now, and I'm having a hard time finding records of his existence on the Internet.

If any of you have the ability, can you confirm whether or not an Irvin Bush (spelling may vary) was a professor at your university? It would mean a lot.

Thanks

**update:** cornell's human resources didn't play ball, required a signed release of information. but someone else in the faculty still ended up getting back to me. Irvin's story is false. http://cl.ly/image/2v2E3a3n1j04 Hotel School on The Simpsons -  Traveling from Central Jersey to Ithaca this weekend, let me know if you need a ride. - I'm planning to drive up to Ithaca this weekend from the Central Jersey Area (around New Brunswick).

Seniors: Looking back, what do you wish you had known as a freshman undergrad? -  6 days until Slope Day.

I've been using the libraries, but I really want a unique place to study. How to meet more artsy kids at Cornell - I'm a pretty outgoing guy who loves to party; however, I did not pledge because I cannot really stand greek life. With all my friends now engaged w/ that, I am now having trouble finding more likeminded people. how does one go about meeting the more artsy kids at cornell?  Why is it so easy to transfer into Cornell? - I'm not trying to look down on transfers. But for the state endowed colleges, I've read about a few students with low gpas in high school (speaking 2.7s...) who managed to get As in community college and transferred in after just a year (one person transferred after a semester) with no extracurriculars and just nothing...

And some of these transfers aren't just... prepared for Cornell? I know a transfer who is in ILR and thinks it is an extremely hard major (this person is getting Ds on exams when the medians are B+s and A-s...). 

Therefeore, what is the point of trying so hard in high school just to have this happen? I'm not looking down on anyone who's a transfer, some of them are the smartest people I know and some ended up with the guaranteed transfer. But I just don't get why Cornell lets in so many people who are just not qualified. Is it for their tuition money? Like I just don't get it [Discussion] We Have A Wiki!

Cornell / Harvard SF Holiday Party - December 10th -  New Coach USA express bus to NYC -  Where can I find dorks like me? - And I use the word dork very affectionately.

My favorite things to do to relax on the weekends are watching movies and shows, playing games (pc, ds, ps, xbox, wii, all of the above), chowing down on junk, and cracking up from the stupidest jokes imaginable.

I haven't found a group like that here. All my friends just want to go out and drink and party and, while that's fun every once in a while, I'd rather sit on a couch and play CIV or something. Which of course means that I don't meet very many people.

Any clubs I should go look at? Anyone recommend anything?
