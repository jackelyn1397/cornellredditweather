Good job, Big Red. -  Mods and subs of /r/Cornell, please help grow this sub - Even though this community is quite small and has low activity, it's been a huge help to me on several occasions. There should definitely be more efforts to expand this sub and advertise it to Cornellians.            
                    
 Imagine how great it would be if we could get the thousands of Cornellians subscribed to their respective classes' facebook pages to migrate over here where people can get answers to their questions more easily and discuss campus ongoings anonymously.       
                     
This sub has consistently given me invaluable knowledge about Cornell ranging from schedules to party life and everything in between, and I wish more people at Cornell could get that knowledge if they so desired to. 
    
 I don't know exactly what it would take, but show your friends the subreddit and get them subscribed if they have a reddit account; if they don't, encourage them to make one so they can sign up. Mods, communicate with the owners of Cornell "Class of ___ " facebook pages and see if you can advertise this sub on all those pages. Hell, if some of you are ambitious enough even print out quarter cards or hang up fliers in your residence halls.
        
 In short, this sub is a great resource run by actual students and offers advice and experiences that you really just can't get from academic advisors, professors, etc. and I wish more Cornellians knew about it. So even if it means just getting one friend to subscribe here, we should all try to grow this sub.

Ithaca is beautiful during the summer and there is so much to do outside (parks, hanging out near the water etc). Without the stress of classes and the copious amounts of students you get to know Ithaca a little better as well. 

I know the weather sucks know but its worth waiting for the sun to come out.  Visited the campus this past weekend, thought this subreddit might enjoy this photo. -  NSFW content on Cornell WiFi? - Don't upvote this, please. Does Cornell care about/monitor NSFW content on the WiFi it provides (dorms, RedRover)?

I'm a freshman at Cornell and I'm really starting to dislike the drinking culture here. I've been to a frat party almost every week I've been here, and I've noticed so many things here. Seeing 4 ambulances outside my residence hall this night is what motivated me to write this. 

Drinking is like machinery here. People all around me go out on the weekends, no matter how much work they have, if they've been invited somewhere or not, etc. The weekend is time to drink and that's unchangable. You pregame at X o clock, catch the bus at Y, go to the party for Z, etc. Every weekend I see almost everyone on my floor do this. I see crowds of dozens of people all going to CTown or west campus or wherever they can get some booze. 

At the parties themselves, people all are just trying to get a beer or whatever alcohol they can lay their hands on. It's honestly just depressing. Everyone complains that the beer is so bad, yet they keep drinking. Do they really need to be drunk that badly? 

I hear endless stories of girls that can't wait to go out and then those same girls getting assaulted at night or making a decision they regret. But they go and do it again the next weekend.

I hear guys stressing about how hard it is for them to find a ratio that works and how annoying and douchey the frat guys are. But they go and do it again the next weekend.

Kids with so much potential are drinking themselves to a point of injury (I've seen so many ambulances show up to different dorms or houses). But they go and go it again the next weekend.

Why? I wish I knew. I'll admit why I go: peer pressure. Everyone is going out and I feel left out if I don't. I went out again this weekend, and hated it. I didn't even drink. But can Ivy League students really not find any other way to have fun during the weekends? Does everyone who drinks think that since they had a hard week they need to alter their reality for a couple of hours to relax?

I wanted to get your guys' opinions on the matter. And I understand that not everyone at Cornell drinks. There are thousands who don't. I'm talking about the culture of those who do.

You have sit for seven hours and you are tired. You get off the car to take a break, buy some coffee and take a shit. It's a 5 minutes break. But after you go back, the bus is gone. You start to run as fast as you can but youcan't catch it. Then you give up, sitting in the middle of nowhere and wondering what you should do...

Hey, something Cornell related made /r/all ag...oh wait.... -  Freshmen start eating at West Campus... -  You guys really enjoyed the Slope photo, here's the Observatory! -  Greetings from your new moderators! - Hi everyone! It's /u/laveritecestla, /u/TheD3xus, and /u/Enyo287, your new /r/Cornell moderating staff! We wanted to take the time to introduce ourselves to you guys, that way everyone can get a better idea of who we are and what we plan on doing to help improve the subreddit. We want to be here for you as a community, and we want to be on the same page with what people are looking to get out of the subreddit.

#/u/laveritecestla
Hi r/Cornell! I'm /u/laveritecestla, and I'm super excited to be one of the new mods here. I'm a current student in biomedical engineering, and am involved in many extracurricular activities on campus. I plan to deal largely with content management (updating the sidebar, creating a comprehensive FAQ section, etc.) and weekly threads (chance me, Q&A for prospective students, etc.). If there are any weekly threads you'd like to see, please let me know (by PM).  I can't promise we'll end up implementing all of your ideas, but we may be able to create threads that encompass several of your ideas at once. Looking forward to improving this subreddit! 

# /u/TheD3xus
Hello /r/Cornell! I'm /u/TheD3xus, one of three new ~~dictators~~ moderators for the subreddit. I've been involved with the subreddit for a while, and I'm glad that I'll be able to help the subreddit grow and prosper (with the community's help, of course). I'm currently a student in Information Science (CALS), and will be in charge of maintaining the visuals of the subreddit (primarily CSS, user/link flair, and more). If you have any ideas, comments, or feedback regarding how the subreddit looks, please shoot me a message or send some modmail. Thank you guys!

#/u/Enyo287
Hiya everybody! Im Enyo  2015 alumnus of Arts & Sciences. In a nutshell, Im a historian, a librarian, a gamer, a huge nerd, and a Jeep owner. In my day-to-day life, Im working full-time while finishing up the second year of my Masters degree - also a full-time commitment! 

Within the context of our subreddit community, Ill be focusing primarily on janitorial aspects such content moderation, answering modmails, and the like. I plan to set up an IRC channel [a text-based chat room, essentially] which Ill keep an active eye on as well. 

Its worth to mention here that although there is a division of responsibilities, these arent necessarily hard and fast lines in the sand. As in any team environment, boundaries, interests, and projects all overlap. Therefore, well be collaborating together as a working team. So as the others have touched upon, please feel free to reach out to any [or all] of us with your comments, suggestions, and concerns. All three of us wish to facilitate the revival and development of our online community  but we wont be able to do it without your help!

I feel like cornell made a mistake accepting me. Im trying really hard to catch up in all my classes. Im terribly homesick.

http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1nevjj/so_a_man_gave_me_this_flier_as_i_was_walking_to/

Someone then found his website and it says the following in a blogpost: 
"I can do some touring for a few months at least right now. Maybe even 5-6 months. I'm thinking about maybe joining the military in 2014 by summer. I've sort of had that fantasy since 2008 now, after times got tough. I figure in the long term, "order" won't hurt me, where this country is headed. I'm on the road, driving. **I'm headed to CU, B. Hall, in I, NY.** Them are initials for something. Figure it out. I'm serious."

what Getting used to not liking college - Title pretty much sums it up. Cornell is meh. Lots of work. Isolated place, lots of competition, little time for socializing. Sophomore CS.

You know, this year I said I would socialize more and it's been fun and all, but my grades have suffered, my sleep schedule is garbanzo beans, and I don't even think I'm any happier.

That said, I'm used to it at this point. My high school friends are having a blast at their lib arts schools. We out here tho.

go big red To the man who just yelled out "YO OMAR!" on College Ave tonight - Thank you. I've been whistling the Farmer in the Dell at Cornell for years now, and when someone finally acknowledged it, I was at a loss of how to respond. But thank you, you made my night. I walked home with a huge grin on my face. I hope to meet you some day!

I know new students generally get seats in those sections, but come on...there are some things that you can do as students that us townies can't, so do your part to help make Lynah live up to the reputation of being the most hostile environment for visiting teams!

edit: forgot one Cornell Gangnam Style (flash mob practice) -  I need a favor related to Cornell's history - will pay! - I don't attend Cornell, but my late grandfather was one of the first Indian students to do so (back in the early 1960s, on a government scholarship offered for research scientists after Indian independence). I recently learned that the Cornell library contains the only remaining copy of his Master's thesis. I want to present a bound copy to my father for his 25th anniversary. It would be amazing if someone could photocopy this thesis and send it to me. It's located at the University Annex, which seems to have a system for doing this type of stuff:
https://annex.library.cornell.edu/content/annex-requests-information

This document is clearly in the public domain, having been published between 1923 and 1963 without the copyright being extended in 1989. It's complicated but I can explain via PM; if interested, you can also refer here:
http://www.copylaw.com/new_articles/PublicDomain.html

Anyways, if someone would be willing to photocopy this document and send it to me so that I don't have to travel all the way to Ithaca, I'd gladly pay $40. I'm happy to provide all the documentation and verification you'd need so that you know I'm legit.

Thanks!

(EDITED - to add more information) Gannett Psychiatry - What's up guys

i'm a freshman who suspects clinical depression, and I finally feel the confidence to approach counseling. Should I schedule an appointment with gannett or should I look elsewhere?  These are the first images  of Cornell's NYC Tech Campus -  unbearably lonely - I'm a new sophomore transfer, and I'm really struggling socially- it's been two months and I don't have a single friend. I didn't have friends at my old school (or high school...), and I really hoped that Cornell would be a fresh start and I would finally "find my people". I joined clubs that I'm interested in, I talked to people during orientation, but nothing really panned out and now I feel like everyone has settled into a routine and isn't actively looking for new friends.

I know that I have a lot of underlying social anxiety/self esteem issues that are holding me back, so I'm trying to figure out how to get through that. Therapy was something my parents wanted me to look into when I was having similar problems at my old school, so I called Cornell Health counseling last week, but they told me it would be over a month before I could make an appointment. I don't want to go to EARS or any of that bullshit, but I don't know what my other options are.

I can feel myself slipping back into the same depressive cycle I was in last year, and while I really don't want that to happen I don't know how to prevent it. Seeing everyone with their friends at homecoming and halloween parties makes me want to cry because I feel like I'll never get to have those experiences.

:( New freshman struggling socially - I dont really know where to go with this so Im just bringing it here. Im a new freshman and Im just really struggling socially. Im not (normally) a particularly introverted or anti-social person, but when I arrived here I pretty just froze up. I havent made any friends since getting and in reality only have a few acquaintances. I know its still relatively early, but it does seem like people are solidifying legitimate friend groups, and I just dont know what to do at this point to go about making friends. Id appreciate any sort of advice possible.

So for a while now I've been making this mobile app for Cornell students. I'm just releasing it/ publicizing it today. Describing it simply, it has a ton of locations around campus with hours/details/arrivals/menus/etc. that I can live update with information and that you can find easily for when you're walking around campus. It has a one-time cost of 99 cents, but please check out the app-descriptions and see if you think it's worth it. I started this project to use for myself and just wanted to bring it to others, so I will continue updating it and making it even better. If you have any questions please comment below and I'll answer anything.

Coach Archer career W-L record is 3-15.  Ugh.


Cornell at Columbia on November 15 (12:30PM EST) Lacrosse team suspended and all games cancelled due to hazing allegations -  hey cornell your uni is rad as fuck <3 from australia, i had a great time (and on a tuesday!) -  Kicked Out of Cornell for a Semester - As stated in the titled, I am placed on academic leave for a semester due to my poor academics. I failed 3 courses since the beginning of my freshman year including multi-variable calc, bio, and a writing seminar driving down my GPA to 1.7. The root cause was mainly from a lack of motivation, languishing in my dorm for hours on end, and skipping classes for weeks at a time. Perhaps this was a symptom of depression that I had refused to seek out help for or perhaps it was from the increasingly hectic domestic situation in which my parents' fights constantly involved me even though I was hundreds of miles away from home. Whatever the cause, I have come to terms with it and will strive for a more successful remainder of my time at Cornell. So far in this semester I was gone, I had received certifications in EHAC, FEMA, OSHA, Psychological Aid, and inbound marketing while taking 3 courses at my local community college to fulfill distribution requirements. I also picked up a job, volunteered at the Miami AFL-CIO, and Hurricane Relief Shelters. I will mention these in my reflections for reentry in the spring semester. The question remains as to how I will graduate on time. Having missed a semester is a significant roadblock to graduate with my class and I'm not sure as to how to make up for missed time. I'm willing to take 20-22 credits per semester, but even then I'm not sure it'll remedy the situation. I just want to know if you guys have any advice for recovery and recuperation. I'm in the ILR school if this helps. Thank you in advance for the help!

edit: Thanks everyone for the responses! I know we're strangers on the internet, but the level of support and encouragement in this subreddit is quite terrific. I think the willingness of my fellow Cornellians to help some random guy on the internet is indicative of the character of this community. I will take these recommendations to heart and strive to be a better person. I just wanted to let you know you helped one stranger get to a better place mentally. 

With utmost gratitude,

cornellthrowaway Why do I have to eat at my own house during house dinners. - The meal plan says I have Unlimited access to meals during designated service periods within the West Campus House System dining rooms. So freaking stupid to be turned down by the person at the card swiping station because its not my house. Well maybe I dont want to eat the few foods that were prepared at my specific dining hall. Literally cannot stand house dinners. Also the gross used cloth napkins people leave all over the table because nobody knows where to put them. Maybe they should actually tell you the rules of house dinners in the description. Ugh  Cornell football wins, beats Columbia 3-0 - In shutout fashion, Cornell won its first game of the season.  Congratulations to Coach Archer and the team -- a home victory at Schoellkopf Field is a good way to break into the win column. I feel dirty signing up for Psych experiments -  bored in class, and your links are all purple? -  October 22nd - Cornell meetup - Let's do it on the 22nd. 
I don't live on collegetown so I really dont know that many restaurants. What's a good, affordable restaurant that can fit a pretty large party?

Also, if one of you could be so kind to invite us for video games, board games, etc, that would be great. I live in a small apartment so i don't think cramming into my apartment would be a good idea.


Thanks~~ Cornell Redditors meetup? - It's college, there's gotta be a lot of redditors around campus.
Let's have a meetup sometime after fall break! Chem 2070 Prelim 2  - Holy s&@t. I have no words for the second Chem 2070 prelim.  People in tears. WTF.   I'm still in shock. Comments anyone?

See (some of you) on Saturday! Is there a place on campus where I can learn new instruments? - I doubt this exists but thought I might as well ask!

I'm not musically talented but like to learn new creative skills to destress.. are there any organizations, clubs, or classes that teach instruments to beginners? I'm interested in percussions, guitar, piano, or even learning to handle studio equipments! (Not so much wind instruments at the moment)

Thank you! I am burnt out, what to do? - It's midway through the semester and I feel so burnt out. I feel unmotivated and I don't want to do anything. Does anyone have any tips/advice. It's been nonstop prelims and work that I just want ths semester to end. I thought my fall break would be a good time for me to recuperate but I'm still worn out and now I have another prelim and then a prelim after that and it's just neverending. i'ts just such a grind. does anyone have tips finding internships is stressful as hell -  Transfer Students Forced to Live in North Campus Lounges -  originally posted about canada - applicable for ithaca as well! -  Cornell these days -  Last Call for College Bars -  Secrets of RPCC -  The spiders on the bridge... -  3110 Prelim - I'm getting weeded out  i can't be the only one who thinks info sessions are awkward as hell? - specifically the networking part when you have 200+ people trying to speak to like 6 representatives from the company. and everyone is pushing while trying not to seem passive aggressive about it??

i mean i understand why they hold these network sessions but its just so awkward and I just can't see how it's comfortable having all these people crowd around you Hotel Ezra Cornell Waitresses' Derby, Hotel Admin, March 1944. -  an accurate representation -  Are there actually good ways to get help on campus? - The past year or so has really not been going super well for me and I'm at the point where I don't feel like I can deal with my problems anymore. I want to know if someone can help without making things worse. I've had friends deal with Cornell's mental health system in the past and they just got sent home for a semester and that didn't really seem to help them much and I don't think prolonging this another year is actually going to help what's been stressing me, so I'd rather avoid ending up like that if possible, but I also don't want to waste my time just chatting with someone who's just going to give me nonsense advice like trying to be positive. I'm already stressed about all the stuff I have to do, so throwing away more time doesn't seem useful. 

I just don't know what to do at this point. It's 5 in the morning and I got no sleep tonight between my cold and my freaking out about all the class I've missed on top of all my other problems. I can't just keep going on like this and end up being fine with my classes, but I can't think of a way to help this problem that doesn't involve me just repeating the process again a year later. It's not even just the work that's the issue, but it certainly doesn't help to feel like I don't even have the time to think about and deal with these problems properly.

Fall 2016 Finals Schedule now available -  PSA for club officers: Cornell club budgets cut by up to 33% this year - If you are an officer in a club at Cornell, you should be aware that the SAFC has greatly lowered the funding caps for each club tier this year.

The cuts hit the lower tier clubs especially hard--if you are in a small tier 6 club, your funding cap has been lowered by 1/3rd this year.

Soph transfer here, I'm struggling a lot with adapting to cornell (not in the academic sense).

Backstory: I've struggled with depression for many years now and the biggest thing affecting me is a total lack of motivation. I had an awful experience at my previous uni and I thought coming to Cornell would help, but it hasn't. It has prevented me from functioning correctly (i.e. im too depressed/have no motivation to apply for jobs, spend time with friends, join clubs, etc.) 

When I went to Clubfest i had this same problem. I had no motivation to join any of the clubs and I would be forcing myself to join if i did. However, 2 clubs actually caught my eye and interested me a lot (something that rarely happens nowadays). I poured my heart and soul into preparing for their tryouts (again, something I rarely do) and both of them rejected me, and its been hitting me REALLY hard. I've lost the sliver of motivation I had when trying out for these clubs and everything feels mechanical. It feels devastating knowing my best isn't good enough for either of them (and one of these clubs I did in HS for 2 years, so I thought I would do well enough...)

I do go to counseling sessions at CHealth, but other people don't really understand. They tell me things like "just join other clubs", but i physically cannot force myself to join a club I have no motivation to pursue. Any advice for what to do next? I am still not a member of any clubs, and I feel massive guilt for not doing anything on campus.
