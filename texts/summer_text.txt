In the Ivy League, /r/Cornell is #1 in reddit subscriber count. - It's something I guess. Sounds a hell of a lot better than #1 in Title IX cases. 
 
 
 
I'm going to give one fact about each of the other Ivy subreddits that highlights the fact that /r/Cornell is far superior.

**Brown** (1404 subscribers) - Currently has 2 moderators. One created the sub 6 years ago, the other is class of 2021 and doesn't attend Brown yet. Edit: Also uses Naut for their subreddit design. Lazy ass mods. 

**Columbia** (2424 subscribers) - Has no CSS design, completely vanilla. Lazier ass mods. 

**Dartmouth** (711 subscribers) - I mean... its Dartmouth. 

**Harvard** (2766 subscribers) - The only subreddit to not have links to the rest of the Ivy League in the sidebar. Pompous assholes. 

**Princeton** (1577 subscribers) - Most upvoted post of *all time* has 44 upvotes. 

**University of Pennsylvania** (2006 subscribers) - 2 flairs exist. Both are empty flairs. What?

**Yale** (1586 subscribers) - Only has 2 mods, neither of which currently attend Yale, and their most recent post is someone asking about something called tuition insurance.




I'm really *really* bored at my internship, okay? Kyle the cat is HOME! - Hello everyone! I posted awhile back about my sister's cat "Kyle" who had hitched a ride allll the from Cortland to Ithaca in a car (unbeknownst to the driver) and made his exit in the Fall Creek neighborhood.  After 9 days of countless hours and walking God knows how many miles of searching, WE GOT HIM!!!  Thank you all for your support and concern!   Hi /r/Cornell, I did a thing in 4K! Hope you like it :) -  Two IC Students Stabbed at Cornell on Sunday Morning; One dead, One in Critical Condition -  Can we please have a rule against admission threads? - The questions and answers for these threads are always the exact same. OP: "Here's my GPA, activities resume, etc. What are my chances of getting in?" Commenters: "We're not admissions officers; there's no way of telling. Just apply and good luck." It's redundant to say the least any time a thread like this is posted. The purpose of the subreddit is for people to talk about the ongoings of Cornell, events at the college, class questions, and the like. If you hop on over to /r/Harvard right now you can see that admissions posts aren't allowed there because they were plagued by these crappy threads to the point it was unbearable, and we shouldn't have to wait until we get to that point. Literally all of these questions could be better answered by a simple google search or post on College Confidential.

TL;DR: Admissions questions are pointless and fill up the front page with redundant questions and answers; let's get rid of them. Today I went to Wegman's for the first time.

The address is still cornell.ignorelist.com:4000 How has coming to Cornell changed you? - Academically? Personally? Professionally?

How much do you think you've changed since you were a freshman and now (especially if you're graduating)? I've written a book about founding reddit (and 'net entrepreneurship), but I need your help getting me to Cornell - Howdy! We're building an epic college book tour for my book, [Without Their Permission](http://ohanian.co/WTPBOOK), but a couple of schools haven't been as responsive as we'd hoped, so I'm turning to the school's subreddit for some help.

If you can help, please email me at epicbooktour@alexisohanian.com -- I'd really appreciate it.

Also - where should we all go for the /r/cornell meetup afterwards? Surely there are some good watering holes.... The Onion covers Cornell's bridge solution. -  So I found this gem of a Cornell Shirt... -  Summer lovin' - As a recent Cornell alumnus, I remember fondly enjoying the hiking and flora around Ithaca and campus. However, there really is no more appropriate way to celebrate a visit to Cornell than to find a secluded meadow or glen and make sweet whoopee. However, nothing is more of a buzzkill than having some poor soul come across you and your lady, with your Big Red flopping in the breeze.

Any particularly good locations around, say, the plantations?

Sincerley,
Definitely not Cornell PD Anyone know what the Pokemon Go situation is like on campus? - Question is in the title.  Any Pokestops around?  Gyms? How it feels staying in Ithaca for the summer. -  I'm totally lost. - I'm going to be a senior in Computer Science and I have absolutely no idea what I want to do after I graduate. Now this may be a common problem, but I think if I have deeper issues because I get incredibly depressed at the thought of working in an office environment at a cubicle. It feels incredibly stifling and monotonous to me. 

I had an internship at a Fortune 500 company last summer that I really disliked, and I quit my internship at that same company 2 weeks into this summer because I just couldn't pull through mentally. To be honest, I only majored in CS because my parents told me to. I haven't enjoyed it at all. And frankly I attended Cornell because my parents told me to as well; otherwise, I most likely would have just gone to my highly regarded state school (they did pay for my education in full though, which I'm incredibly grateful for).

I've always liked the thought of owning my own business. There's this new building in a shopping plaza that opened up near my house.  Every time I walk by I always think to myself how great it would be if I were to run a business in a space like that. But I don't have any idea as to WHAT that business would entail.  

And of course, even if I did have an idea as to what that business would be, it's incredibly risky to pursue something like that and forgo traditional employment. Am I just lazy? Depressed? Naive? I just can't seem to come up with what I'd like to end up doing if I weren't running my own thing. I will be going to career services when I get on campus, but from what I've heard, they aren't particularly helpful. 

Meanwhile, my classmates seem to be enjoying their highly paid internships in New York City, Bay Area, etc, and all I've done is sit at home trying to make sense of things. Does anybody have advice for someone who just feels incredibly lost and hopeless?  Cornell Club NYC - Is anyone a member?  Is it worth the cost?  I live and work in the area, so I was planning on primarily using it as a gym, though the other amenities could potentially be useful. Pollack Cuts Ties With Nike Citing Failure to Meet Labor Guidelines -  Map of Collegetown  - Just discovered r/Cornell. 

As a gift, [here's a map I did of Collegetown](http://www.metaezra.com/images/ctown_map.JPG) in the Spring of 2009. I've always liked maps and a hallucinogenic experience prompted me to follow through on this one.

There's a few mistakes and Green Cafe, Sinbad's, among others, have been replaced. There's even a Hookah Bar I don't know about now. Hopefully you can find help me find mistakes and log them here.

One day I'll update the map, print it on cheap newspaper and have it distributed freely.

Are there any opportunities that you guys have heard of/participated in that were really cool or fun, but which nobody in the student body seemed to have ever heard of? (I originally saw this post on USC's page but thought it'd be fun to discuss here too! Figured there's a lot of stuff that goes on on this giant campus)  Man Charged with Murder Tuesday Hours after Police Find Body at Collegetown Construction Site -  How did you meet some of your closer friends at Cornell? (from a lonely freshman) - Hi,

I realize it's still very early into college, and clubs are the best way to meet people, but I'm feeling a bit hopeless. I came from a big NYC high school that has a large representation here but I only talk to ~4 of them, and we're not that close. Also they all know each other well so I feel excluded from that group.

I do talk to some people who live near me but they're in Hotel/Architecture while I'm in Engineering (CS major btw) so we can't see each other that often. I talked to a lot of people during orientation, but I didn't find a lot that had common interests with me (I guess that's what clubs are for?) I haven't been able to talk to people in my classes, and everyone already seems to have friends that they eat/walk with. 

I feel overwhelmed and miserable, and I feel a lot more pressure to find friends/hang out with people than I did back home (where I did have a good group of friends that has now scattered). 

I guess what I'm asking is, do you have any advice with dealing with this? Is there anything I can do until or even after the club fair? Any stories relating to this? I'm not too into parties btw.

TLDR: Having trouble making friends, especially in my college/major. Need advice.

My swim class starts tomorrow and Im not about to go big red without tampons.   Need good advice. In awful situation. - I am in the worst situation right now. I made the mistake of not applying for housing next year because I figured I would be living in a fraternity house, I joined a Fraternity...then left it. After that I applied to be on the wait list and then was told it's unlikely I would get any sort of housing. After a couple of emails they said that I am on their 'priority' list for some sort of housing (I even said a temporary quad would be ok, yes i'm that desperate). Every dime of my tuition is paid for in loans because my family cannot afford for me to attend (the loans are in my name). So as you might imagine I can't afford to live off campus, something I obviously should have considered when I decided to not apply for housing . School is 2 weeks away and I have nowhere to live. I don't know what I am looking for, but any help someone might be able to give would be appreciated. Thanks. How intensive are the beginner art classes? - I'm an engineer and thinking of taking ART 2201: Intro to Painting as one of my liberal studies distributions. How rigorous and time consuming is this kind of course? I've tried looking online and I've read many bad reviews of the instructor. I've never had any prior experience painting, and I've also read that these kind of courses are incredibly difficult to pass if you do not have the innate talent. just witnessed all sorts of incompetence on the Fall Creek bridge -  Cornell removes webpage touting power of 2% in fraternities -  Trying to Quarter Card at Club Fest -  How it feels staying in Ithaca for the summer [FIXED] -  Just wanna say that this subreddit is nice. - As nerdy as this sounds, having an online "reddit-community" here for Cornell like this is nice.  It would have helped the socially-awkward and those who stayed in their room mostly.  I was gonna say, "I didn't have this in my time," but I did, although there were a maximum 7 posts on here for about a year.

That being said, everyone should make effort to go out and meet people face to face.  Just that I'm definitely grateful that there are more posts on here now.

I just got settled into my apartment and am feeling a little overwhelmed by how much *stuff* there is around here. I got my BA in a town where the most exciting thing to do was walk to Walgreens, so this is a lot more life than I'm used to. I've given myself a little walking tour of (parts of) campus and I've been down to the Commons a few times, but I know there's a lot more to be seen. What are your favorite places around here? 

For reference, I live basically on top of Cascadilla gorge and, while I prefer walking in the summertime, have a car.  Reminder: Reddit Meetup this Saturday (9/1), details inside! - As many of you know, the official /r/Cornell meetup was moved to this upcoming Saturday because of a scheduling conflict with the free concert last weekend. We were also considering changing the venue, but it looks like the weather is going to cooperate and so we're planning to have the meetup in my backyard so we can use the grill/fire pit out back. There will be food and drinks (just please don't show up already drunk), and feel free to bring friends!

j/k <3 Ya'll Recent Cornell grad willing to answer any questions! - Hey guys,

I graduated from Cornell May 2015 and am quite proud to say Cornell was one of the best highlights of my life. It seems surreal that exactly 6 years and 2 days ago, I first walked onto the campus during move in day; hearing that school starts again really made me feel nostalgic. 

Quick background on me - I came in as a sophomore year transfer but stayed an extra year due to changing majors, and ended up getting full 4 years of experience as a Big Red. I majored in ORIE in the engineering school and currently am working my dream job, having a blast.

Hopefully this doesn't come off as one of those self-proclaimed "AMA's", but would love to try and offer my insights and answer any questions incoming (or even current) students may have.

My cat is missing! -  Failed Course, Need Help - Hi,

I'm a freshman (rising sophomore), biological sciences major in CALS on a pre-med track. I just finished my first year up and got solid grades all around (Generally B+ or higher) except first semester Gen. Chem I got a C+, and this past semester I actually failed the class. Seeing as I'm pre-med, I need to take Organic Chem. to stay on the path for graduation at a normal rate, but I failed CHEM 2080, which is a pre-req for Orgo. I just need some advice as to what my best course of action is here, as I know I struggle with Chemistry, but I have a hard time letting go of my pre-med goal because of a few classes in college.

Thanks for any response in advance, feel free to be critical if necessary. i know this question has been asked 1,000,000x before so sorry (for the gays) -   I heard there were 'gay parties' (don't know why that's in quotes) on campus but I'm not in that secret facebook group (don't have one) so I was wondering of there was any other way for me to uh...get involved in that. I'm a freshman and I have met 0 gay people so far so can't go in that direction either...

Best/most interesting class(es) you've taken at Cornell? - Just wondering, but also for future reference Why does it say coinciding class even though they don't overlap? -  Does PsiU get to keep their house? - Since they were removed from campus, and that property is technically owned by Cornell, hypothetically speaking if a frat returned to campus that was previously dormant, would they be able to settle in the old PsiU house? I know that in the DKE suspension, Cornell agreed to allow the DKE to resettle the house once they returned but no where does it seem the case for PsiU. Can I join the pep band without already having an instrument to play? And as a grad student? - Also please sound off on what instrument you'd recommend. I'm so new to this whole thing that I'm considering every instrument right now. Everything seems cool. Though playing a drum seems especially cool, even if my apartment mates will surely disagree after a while. A friend who just graduated Cornell & was active in the band community asked me winds vs brass as a starting question when I said I wanted to join, and I was so caught up in the options that I froze up and said "drums."
