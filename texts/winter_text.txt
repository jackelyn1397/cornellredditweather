HARVARD SUCKS -  High school senior gets accepted to Cornell, his dream college (x-post from /r/gifs) -  It's the most wonderful time of the year -  Cornell Basic Boys Starter Pack -  Cornell Basic Girls Starter Pack -  After coming back from break... -  anyone else extremely disappointed with the Cornell Admissions AMA? - recent alumni here. there were some really thoughtful questions that went unanswered. in fact, the admissions committee only answered like 4 or 5 questions total! Upset because I think it makes the school look worse than having never done the AMA at all. 

EDIT: looks like they'll be back on today to answer a few more questions! hopefully a redemption is in the making Quiet place to study in Collegetown - Need a good place to study? St. Luke Church (right next to CTB) is OPEN TO ALL for quiet study now through Wednesday Dec 14, 10am to Midnight (Sundays  1pm to Midnight). Wireless available throughout the building. FREE coffee and tea (and usually snacks). People are welcome to bring your own food and there are several small group study rooms available. No proselytizing, just supporting our college community by offering up the space for those in need.  To every anxious applicant to Cornell looking for advice/chances... - Yes, you have a chance. No, we don't know what it is. No, that doesn't disqualify you. Yes, that thing matters. No, that thing isn't the only thing that matters. Yes, Cornell is cold. No, youwait, you were arrested for what?

&nbsp;

Everybody here is really glad that Cornell is your first, or second, or third, or eighty sixth choice. We all hope that you become a part of our world, and as much as we make fun of them, we also really love new Freshman. 

&nbsp;

You all have a ton of anxiety regarding college admissions right now. You might get in, you might not, none of us really have any idea as we don't sit on the admissions board. But something to remember when you're posting here and on CC and agonizing over GPA percentiles and ACT scores, the college you attend does not matter nearly as much as how you take advantage of every opportunity given to you.

&nbsp;

Not only that, you also have to remember to just live and be free. Do something stupid. Do a lot of things fun. Make art and be happy. You have the rest of your life to be worried about things much more important than what college you are admitted to.

&nbsp;

You've probably read this same message a billion times. There is a reason. Listen to it.

Dr. Henry Heimlich, life-saving maneuver creator and loyal Cornellian, dies at 96 -  My Great-Great Grandpa's degree from 1904 -  Cornell Admissions AMA on Tuesday, December 8th over at r/iama - Hey r/Cornell! We know most of you are already at Cornell, but we see quite a few prospective students coming here to ask for advice about applying to Cornell, so we thought we'd hold an AMA on Tuesday, December 8th. If you're already a Cornellian, we'd love your upvotes for visibility on Tuesday at the AMA over at r/iama. If you're a prospective student, get your admissions questions ready!

We saw an imposter Cornell Admissions post the other day, so we thought we should give some actual admissions advice to Redittors who aspire to become Cornellians. 

We'll be providing lots of proof, so you know it's us. We're frequent lurkers of this sub and you all do a great job representing Cornell, especially sharing what it's like to be a student at Cornell, so thanks for that!

 A message to all the ED applicants - If you got accepted, congratulations! 

If you didn't get accepted, it is very easy to feel terrible, but you really shouldn't(especially if Cornell was your first choice). Here are a couple of points to consider. 

* If you didn't get accepted, it does not mean you are stupid. There is always a small percentage of people who get accepted but will do bad, and a percentage of people who doesn't get accepted but could have done well. Also, schools consider more things than the ''intelligence factors'' (i.e. SAT/ACT score, GPA). 

* If you didn't get into Cornell, don't think you won't get accepted in any other more prestigious schools. I, for example, got rejected from UCSD (35.9% acceptance rate), but got admitted here (14% acceptance rate). 

* The college you go won't determine your life. Sure, going to a prestigioss school gives you more resources and will make life easier, but that does not mean that if you don't get in you won't get the job you've always dreamt of. It will simply be a little bit harder.

tl;dr: college application is not a perfect science. Don't feel bad if you got rejected. Congratulations if you did get accepted!

DC++ is back!  A hub is running under new management at the address ***cornell.ignorelist.com:4000***.  To connect, just go to your "Favorite Hubs" screen in the DC++ client, and edit the properties so the address field contains the address above.

It's just as secure as before--since only Cornell IPs are allowed on, outside organizations, such as the RIAA and MPAA, can't see what you upload and download.  Enjoy, and remember to share and reshare! New Subreddit Theme! - I've been toiling away in my secret lair working on a brand new subreddit theme. Out with the old, in with the new and all that funny stuff. Now, I present to you all: the brand new Cornell subreddit theme!

## What's different?
Pretty much everything has received a visual facelift. The flair, the content, the imagery, the colors, everything's more Cornell related. 

## Flair
Everyone now has the ability to set their own flair, prefixed with a few options based on the different Cornell programs and some locales that I thought people might like. At this time there's no ability to set your own prefix, though I'm working on a way to do that.

## Bugs & Feedback
If you find any bugs or if you have some feedback, please leave a comment below and I'll address it ASAP. Enjoy guys! Hey Cornellians, I'll be seeing you soon! -  Cornell to establish College of Business -  I'm going to Cornell! - Accepted Early Decision!

but srsly

i feel like a damn flop and i really hope it's not just me, from being rejected to a lot of student organizations (5% acceptance rates tho xoxooooooooo) or for feeling like i'm worthless because i'm didnt have that internship from some well known company

so behind all my frivolous language, this school has made me feel less confident in myself than i ever thought i could be lol. i seriously hope this isn't just me Early Decision Results Celebration/Commiseration Thread! - To those who were accepted today: 
**WELCOME TO THE CLASS OF 2021!**

To those who were not: Remember, this is not the end of the world. As others have said, the college admissions process doesn't always make sense, and is not a reflection on you as a person. 

Feel free to post your thoughts here! (Keep it civil and friendly though) Best of Cornell: Study Spaces! - Syllabus week has come to a close, and although you may feel like it's too soon, you should probably start thinking about studying for your classes now.

Were people accepting? -  lonely freshman - I'm a second semester freshman, and while I had a great time going out and meeting people last semester, I feel extremely disconnected from the people I hang out with. I like them- but I don't know if we have that much in common (not in an "intellectual I'm so much better" way) and I don't feel like they're real friends because they didn't have my back when I went through a stressful couple of weeks. I know this sounds whiny but I just don't know how to find a close friend group. I'm trying to join clubs and immerse myself in the *student experience* as much as possible, but I have no idea if it'll help. Any ideas on how to reach out to more people or should I let it happen organically? So... - Any idea what's going on?

We hold our meetings at WVBR-FM, near where the old Chapter House stood. The main goal of EBR is to give Cornell students and Ithaca residents a chance to get their music out to a wider audience, through iTunes, Spotify, and traditional networks like radio and print articles.

Since Electric Buffalo Records started last spring, many Cornellians have gotten involved - photographers, musicians, producers, you name it. One of the most active participants has been [Kurt Riley](https://www.facebook.com/kurtrileymusic/), a Cornell senior whose "[scintillating brand of glam/new wave/punk rock that will excite you about the direction of contemporary music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYyVF25VEx0)" 

EBR is very excited about his new album, "Kismet." All of the musicians are Cornell students and Ithaca residents, and it was recorded right on campus - in Lincoln Hall and inside Carl Becker House. The first music video from the album, for the song "[Hush Hush Hush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZHwtbLL8ME)," was shot at the Johnson Museum and in the Commons. Through the entire process of making the record, Kurt Riley has been able to work with some of Cornell's most talented students.

[Please check out "Kismet" on CDBaby when it comes out February 28th.](http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/KurtRiley1) Support local music and your local record label; Electric Buffalo Records is dedicated to bringing you Cornell's most talented students for years to come - and this is where it all starts! Police are investigating multiple reports of graffiti on and near Cornell University -- all with similar themes, paint and phrases. -  [META] About "chance me" threads - Genuinely curious - what's the moderation team's stance on these?  Because I feel like, despite them being relatively nonintrusive otherwise, it's still unpleasant to have droves of maddened high school juniors/seniors asking the same question.

If anything, maybe a sticky/megathread would help reduce/eliminate them.  Just my two cents, though.

Today, Big Red Bullet joins the ranks of the "bollocks to our customers, we'll just cancel the service we sold 'em a while ago" travel businesses: 

"The management team of the Big Red Bullet has been looking at the schedule for the holiday period, particularly since both Ithaca College and Cornell are both on prolonged breaks. Since they are our main source of customers, we have decided not to operate for the period 24 December until 2 January, inclusive. 

We regret that you have already made a reservation during that time frame and we regret any inconvenience this may cause. Both Greyhound and Shortline will continue to operate a full schedule between New York and Ithaca.

You will, of course, receive a full reimbursement for the booking you have made."

 Schafer records 400th win as Men's Hockey Coach -  I screwed up my first semester as a Cornell engineer. - Hello reddit, so I finally calculated my GPA for my first fall semester, and it is currently at a 1.87. For Chemistry 2090, my final grade was soooooo much lower than I expected, and that real destroyed my GPA. Now I know this will put me under poor academic standing, so what will happen next? I passed all my classes, and in particular I got a D, C, C, B-. For next semester, I really fixed my schedule so that I can appropriate a more efficient pattern of studying and sleeping, and I have already started to study for my next semester classes. I am not at all worried or scared and I know that I can fix all of my mistakes from this semester in my next semester. However, in the long wrong, how will this affect me? I successfully managed to join a very top project team and have good other extracurricular activities. Thanks!

If everybody follows these steps, we can have full official Median Grade Reports by next week, maybe in time for Add/Drop.

**1)  Order your official transcript  Follow the steps from here** http://transcript.cornell.edu/
This takes 5 minutes, its completely free, and theyll send your official transcript within 2 days

**2) Find your classes on these spreadsheets and enter the MEDIAN grades listed**

**Spring 2011**

Use ctrl+f  (command+f on a mac) to find your class number
Keep your own grades private and help out the rest of the Cornell community
 
**3) Tell your friends to do the same thing.** The more people who fill in median grades, the more classes well have median grades for, so spread the word

**4) Look at the median grades for classes you want to take**
 
Thanks a lot everyone for helping out. This is an easy thing to do where everyone benefits. These are the real median grades, and will give everybody more info before signing up for classes. When enough of it has been filled out, well make it a downloadable PDF and put the link here. As an added bonus, once 80% of these classes are filled in, Ill make the median grade reports from Spring 2009  Fall 2010 available for download.

If all goes as expected, Harvard will be ranked #1 in the ECAC, with Cornell a point behind, so a win will help Cornell claim first.  Currently, Harvard and Cornell are #3 and #5, respectively, in the national rankings.

These are some of the best hockey players in the WORLD.  It's fast, physical and a lot of fun to watch.  It would be great to fill Lynah Rink for a women's hockey for the first time ever!!

I'm throwing their info out there in case any international students on this sub can benefit. 

Aparently, and I didn't know this before, international students have a hard time getting credit cards. Either they don't have a US credit score or social security number. My buddy partnered with a bank and came up with a system to evaluate creditworthiness without a US credit score. It's pretty genius.

Right now they are only accepting students at Cornell, Columbia and NYU over the age of 21.

While I am beyond happy, I am also terrified about the difficulty and workload. I have heard a lot about Cornell being the hardest ivy to graduate from. I have attended a relatively easy private school and was able to get all A's without much studying. I was able to focus more on my SAT's during High School than my schoolwork. What can I do to prepare for the workload at Cornell? I don't have very good time management or organizational skills at the moment. Thanks for reading.  Leaving Cornell - Do you any of you guys feel like you just want to leave Cornell as fast as possible and start working? Don't get me wrong I really like Cornell and I've met a lot of cool people here. But sometimes I feel like I just want to graduate as fast as I can and start my life. Am I crazy for thinking this? TA/prof lost my final exam, what to do? - So I took a final around 3 days ago for one of my classes in Statler. It was a hard test, but I thought everyone was struggling anyways, so I handed it in at the podium in front. I distinctly remember even being confused about which pile to put my exam books in, and multiple people (my friends who sat near me) saw me go up, as I finished with around 30 min left. Yesterday, I received an email saying that I turned in the question sheet, but not the exam books. The professor asked me if I went and if there were other people who saw me turn it in. He then offered a retake, but I already left campus. I was trying as hard as possible to seem polite, but I got the feeling that he was getting annoyed, as he said he would just give me an incomplete. The TA also said he looked everywhere, and couldnt find it.
At this point, I have no idea what I should do. I contacted my dean, but she has not responded yet, and Im not sure whether my case is worth arguing, if Im going to have to retake the class anyways. Im a CS major, and I need this class to graduate. Any advice would be appreciated! Why doesn't Cornell have a custom reddit icon at the top of the page like the other Ivy reddits? - Edit: 

What do you guys think about this?

It's a great space, but people are constantly sitting on the floor. Is this what they planned, or did they just forget to order enough tables and chairs? seeking verification that Irvin Bush taught at Cornell - Hey Cornell,

I'm a College of Charleston student. I've befriended a homeless man here who is strikingly intelligible and well spoken, has friends in all sorts of upper, surprising social circles. He tells me he taught Computer Science at Cornell University before his wife and children were killed by a drunk driver. I'm curious in him and want to believe what he says, am looking for verification. He's 70 years old now, and I'm having a hard time finding records of his existence on the Internet.

If any of you have the ability, can you confirm whether or not an Irvin Bush (spelling may vary) was a professor at your university? It would mean a lot.

Thanks

**update:** cornell's human resources didn't play ball, required a signed release of information. but someone else in the faculty still ended up getting back to me.

I haven't found a group like that here. All my friends just want to go out and drink and party and, while that's fun every once in a while, I'd rather sit on a couch and play CIV or something. Which of course means that I don't meet very many people.

Any clubs I should go look at? Anyone recommend anything?
